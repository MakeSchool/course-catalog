## Federal and State Student Financial Aid

Starting in Fall 2020, Make School will be offering a new financial aid model that will (in most
cases) replace previous payment methods used by Make School since 2014. This new plan is designed to
reduce the average cost of a Make School Education while preserving the core protections of previous
tuition agreements - if you don’t have a job after Make School, you should not have to pay until you
are employed.

Under our new model, students will take primary financing from Title IV funding (Pell Grants, Direct
Federal Loans, Parent Plus Loans) and private loans. Make School has created a protection plan that
will cap your loan payments as a percentage of your income to ensure your monthly loan payments
remain affordable. If you are unemployed, this plan will drop your monthly payments to $0.

This strongly incentivizes Make School to see you succeed - if you are underemployed or unemployed
after graduating, Make School will be helping pay your loans every month. This new protection plan
is called Extended Income Based Repayment (EIBR) and is fully described further down on this page.

Tuition gap payment assistance will still be used in rare cases as gap financing - to cover the
remainder of tuition and living expenses that a student is unable to fund through federal and
private loans. Like the protected loans described above, if you don’t have a job you will not have
to pay back your tuition assistance loan until you are employed.
