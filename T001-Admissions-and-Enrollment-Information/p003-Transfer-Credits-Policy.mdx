### Transfer Credits Policy

Make School does not permit students to transfer credits for courses that are part of the program’s
Technical Curriculum, but will grant Science & Letters transfer credit units completed at:

- Degree-granting, regionally accredited, post-secondary two- or four-year institutions;

- Post-secondary institutions which are candidates for WASC accreditation; and

- From College Board-approved prior learning standardized examinations; and

- For courses taken at accredited universities outside of the United States.

Students may transfer credits to meet the Science & Letters requirements only and satisfying up to
36 out of the 124 credit units required for the BACS degree. Students must have earned a passing
grade of "C" or above in their previous coursework for the credit to be successfully transferred to
Make School. Please refer to the full list of
[Transfer Credit Policies](https://dominican.smartcatalogiq.com/2019-2020/Academic-Catalog/Academic-Policies-and-Procedures/Transfer-Credit-Policies)
for Science & Letters requirements for more detail. Transfer credits do not count toward attempted
credits on a student’s transcript, but do count toward credits earned toward the Bachelor of Science
degree. Students are not required to pay a fee or be charged for transferring credits.

Make School students may concurrently enroll to take Science & Letters courses at off-campus
accredited institutions and be granted transfer credit for these courses. The maximum number of
transferable units via concurrent registration is 9 units. Students are required to obtain prior
approval for any coursework they seek to take at another institution, and all other relevant
transfer policies apply to concurrent registration. All authorizations for off-campus registration
must be approved by the Office of the Registrar prior to the student’s concurrent enrollment.

Make School does not grant credit for prior experiential learning or college-level learning
experiences.

#### NOTICE CONCERNING TRANSFERABILITY OF CREDITS AND CREDENTIALS EARNED AT OUR INSTITUTION

The transferability of credits you earn at MAKE SCHOOL is at the complete discretion of an
institution to which you may seek to transfer. Acceptance of the BACHELOR DEGREE you earn in the
BACHELOR OF APPLIED COMPUTER SCIENCE program is also at the complete discretion of an institution to
which you may seek to transfer. If the credits or BACHELOR DEGREE that you earn at this institution
are not accepted at the institution to which you seek to transfer, you may be required to repeat
some or all of your coursework at that institution. For this reason you should make certain that
your attendance at this institution will meet your educational goals. This may include contacting an
institution to which you may seek to transfer after attending MAKE SCHOOL to determine if your
credits or BACHELOR DEGREE will transfer.
