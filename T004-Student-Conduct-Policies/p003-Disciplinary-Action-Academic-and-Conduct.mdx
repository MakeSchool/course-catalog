# Disciplinary Action: Academic & Conduct

This section of the Catalog outlines resolution of policy violations, whether academic or
conduct-related.

## Informal Resolution Processes

Informal Resolution is used when the parties agree to resolve interpersonal conflicts or a violation
of the Code of Conduct through conflict resolution (mediation, restorative justice, etc.), or where
the responding party accepts responsibility for violating policy, or when the Dean, Director of
Student and Academic Affairs, or their representative, can resolve the matter informally by
providing remedies to resolve the situation. In any case, the Dean, Director, or their
representative will determine if Informal Resolution will be an option.

It is not necessary to pursue Informal Resolution first in order to pursue Formal Resolution, and
any party participating in Informal Resolution can stop the process at any time and request the
Formal Resolution process., If an Informal Resolution fails after the fact, Formal Resolution may be
pursued (see below).

_PLEASE NOTE: Significant or egregious violations of policies or procedures may not be eligible for
Informal Resolution (as determined by the Dean or Director). Reports of violations of the
Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, or Retalation Policy will be addressed through the
Formal Resoltuion Process._

## Verbal or Written Warnings

Informal Resolutions may include a verbal or written warning from the Dean or the Director of
Student and Academic Affairs. These warnings serve as notice to the student of the violation of the
Code of Conduct and function as a record of the behavior. Verbal or Written Warnings are an interim
measure prior to a Performance Improvement Plan.

## Formal Resolutions: Performance Improvement Plans

When a student is alleged to have violated academic or behavioral policy at Make School, the matter
must be reported to and investigated by the appropriate conduct administrator. In most cases, the
administrator will be the Dean or the Director of Student and Academic Affairs, but can also be
their designee.

The investigation process typically consists of the following (not necessarily in this order):

- Written notification to the student (via email) of the alleged violation of policy;
- An interview with the parties involved in the alleged violation, and any witnesses who may have
  knowledge of the incident or who can provide additional information;
- A summary of the evidence gathered that is shared with the student alleged to have violated
  policy.
- A determination of factual findings and notification of appropriate sanctions and/or follow-up
  action.

Once the investigation is complete and the student has been notified of the violated policy, the
Conduct Administrator will initiate a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) except in cases where
Alternate Conduct Action is required as noted below.

A PIP is a specific plan developed on an individual basis to set clearly articulated goals or
objectives to improve performance. It includes check-ins, transparent expectations, and closely
monitored progress by the conduct administrator and the student’s coach. There are two types of PIPs
based on the type of policy violation: behavioural or academic:

- A **Conduct PIP** issued for Conduct Violations listed in this Course Catalog & Student Handbook.
- An **Academic PIP** is issued for either academic violations listed in the Course Catalog &
  Student Handbook, or when a student is not making Satisfactory Academic Progress.

While on a PIP, a student may be considered not to be in good standing and may have certain
restrictions related to their participation in select programming and events. Examples include, but
not limited to, field trips, mock technical interviews, access to new industry contacts, student
jobs (i.e., Teaching or Resident Assistantships), participation in Student Council, and outcomes
referrals to partner companies. Any such restrictions will be noted in the PIP.

A PIP typically is in effect for a specific time period (usually 30 days) and the student
performance will be re-evaluated at the end of that time period. If a PIP does not result in the
student meeting the goals or objectives, the student may be dismissed or suspended from Make School
either immediately or at the end of the term as denoted in the PIP. Typically, a dismissed student
is not allowed to return to Make School, and a suspended student may be allowed to return by
reapplying the following year.

information.

**Alternate Conduct Action:** Reports of violations of certain policies (i.e., violations of Sexual
Misconduct policies or violation of the Alcohol, Drug & Smoking Policies) may require alternate
conduct action.

## Request for Appeal of Conduct Action

A request for an appeal of the findings and/or sanctions is subject to the grounds outlined below.
All original sanctions imposed remain in effect through determination of the appeal, and both
parties should be timely informed of the status of the request for appeal, the status of the appeal
consideration, and the result of the appeal decision. Requests for Appeal must be submitted in
writing to the Dean of Make School within five (5) business days of receipt of the
findings/sanctions being issued.

Appeal requests are limited to the following grounds:

- A procedural or substantive error occurred that significantly impacted the outcome of the hearing
  (e.g. substantiated bias, material deviation from established procedures, etc.). A summary
  explaining the error must be included with the request for an appeal.
- To consider new evidence,unavailable during the original hearing or investigation, that could
  substantially impact the original finding or sanction. A summary of this new evidence and its
  potential impact must be included with the request for appeal.
- The sanctions imposed are substantially outside the parameters or guidelines set by the University
  for this type of offense or the cumulative conduct record of the responding party. A summary
  explaining the disproportion of the sanctions must be included with the request for an appeal.

Upon receipt of the Request for Appeal, the Dean will designate an Appellate Officer who will
consider the appeal request and all submitted summaries, evaluate the merit of a request for an
appeal in light of the circumstances and the Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion, and make a
determination on whether enough information exists to warrant an appeal review.

If an Appeal Review is Denied: the finding/sanction stands as-is.

If an Appeal Review is Granted: the Appellate Officer will engage in a thorough review of the appeal
request (including the submitted summaries), the original record (including the investigator’s
report), and any other relevant information, and will take one or a combination of the following
actions:

- Uphold the findings and/or sanctions outlined in the Administrative Disposition;
- Modify the findings and/or sanctions outlined in the Administrative Disposition;
- Dismiss the findings and/or sanctions outlined in the Administrative Disposition.

The decision of the Appellate Officer will be considered final and binding for all parties involved.
