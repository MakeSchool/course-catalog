# Title IX: Understanding Harassment & Sexual Misconduct

[Title IX](https://www.dominican.edu/about/safety-and-emergency-information/sexual-misconduct-title-ix-and-discrimination)
protects students enrolled in educational programs or activities from gender discrimination,
harassment, and sexual misconduct. More specifically, it protects against any conduct that has the
intent or effect of unreasonably interfering with one’s performance at Make School, or that creates
an intimidating, hostile, and pervasive environment. Examples of misconduct include (but are not
limited to) offensive verbal comments, inappropriate physical contact, deliberate intimidation,
sexual images in public spaces, and exclusionary or offensive jokes. Harassment does not need to be
recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed. **All students,
both online and on-campus, are protected by Title IX and are entitled to all support services and
supportive measures for students impacted by sexual misconduct.**

All Make School designated Title IX investigators have received
[training](https://icslawyer.com/posting-for-review-higher-ed-investigator-level-1-two-day/) as
required by OCR in §106.45(b)(10)(i)(D).

## Reporting Misconduct

Make School refuses to accept any violation of the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_, including
violations of our standard Conduct Policies and
[Title IX Policy](https://www.dominican.edu/sites/default/files/2020-11/title_ix_policy_dhr_policy_for_employees-after-aug14.pdf).
Those asked to stop inappropriate behaviors are expected to comply immediately and may face further
disciplinary action (i.e., being removed from community spaces, etc.). To keep our community safe,
we encourage reporting conduct violations, and will maintain reporter privacy to the extent
permissible by law and policy. Conduct violations can be reported via our
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form) or emailed directly to our
[Title IX Coordinator](mailto:student.affairs@makeschool.com).

## Reporting Options and Resources

For all Title IX disclosures and incident reports, medical and counseling support or resources will
be offered, and interim remedies may be made available (e.g., room or class schedule change for
respondent or no contact order) to both the Complainant (person who was subject to the alleged
violation) and the Respondent (person alleged of the violation). Based upon the nature of the
incident, Make School students may be subject to the Title IX processes as described below. A report
of this nature will be reflected in Make School’s annual crime statistics if it meets reporting
criteria.

\*In certain instances, the University may need to report conduct to law enforcement authorities
even when the complainant has not decided to do so. The processes listed above may occur
simultaneously, although the Make School’s disciplinary processes and the Criminal process occur
independently of each other.

## Responding to Misconduct

In the event Make School has actual knowledge of a potential violation of the Conduct Policies and
Title IX Policy, Make School will most likely take the actions (not necessarily in this order):

- Identify policies implicated by the alleged misconduct.
- Assess any potential health/safety concerns of parties involved and initiate or assist with any
  necessary interim actions or remedial measures for both the Complainant and the Respondent.
- Provide an advisor, if needed by either party.
- Conduct an immediate inquiry to determine if there is reasonable cause the responding party may
  have violated this policy.
- Prepare the initial Notice of Investigation (NOI) on the basis of the preliminary inquiry.
- Commence a thorough, reliable, and impartial investigation and interview all relevant individuals
  and conduct follow-up interviews as necessary in a promptly manner.
- Provide regular status updates to the parties throughout the investigation.
- Write an executive report summarizing the investigation, supporting evidence, and list of
  witnesses whose information will be used to render a finding. Parties will have 10 days to review
  the executive report when it is completed.
- Submit the Executive Report to the Decision-Making Administrators for review.
- Conduct a live hearing with the opportunity for cross-examination.
- The Decision-Making Administrators determine if the evidence supports a finding of a policy
  violation and, if so, issue appropriate sanctions, with undue delay to each party. _In cases
  involving students where the potential outcomes may be severe or significant (e.g., suspension or
  expulsion), the Decision-Making Administrators will employ a hearing panel format to render
  findings and decisions._
- Review and determine appeal requests, when applicable.
