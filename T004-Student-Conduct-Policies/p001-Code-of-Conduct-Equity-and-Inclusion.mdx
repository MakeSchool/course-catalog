# Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion

The policies described in this section of the Catalog are especially important for students to
understand, as violating these policies may result in the
[Formal Resolution](../student-conduct-policies/disciplinary-action-academic-conduct) process.
Students are expected to follow these policies at all times. Reports regarding potential violations
of these conduct policies can be submitted using the
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form). All policies and processes are
applicable to both online and on-campus students.

Make School nurtures attitudes and behaviors that promote global awareness, inclusivity, and respect
for the dignity of each person regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age,
socioeconomic status, culture, political conviction, religion, or disability.

We are committed to creating an environment in which every individual can work, study, and live
without feeling excluded, unsafe, or harassed. As such, we encourage speech and actions that support
this mission and the identities of our community members, thus emboldening us to thrive as both a
community and as individuals.

You will see our commitment to these tenets at play in our academics in the following ways:

- All members of the College community consider diversity constructively in all planning, policy,
  decision-making, procedural, academic, and administrative operations throughout the College.
- All course curriculum content, pedagogy, syllabi structure, assignments, grading, and learning
  outcomes are built to ensure it does not marginalize identities or implicitly identify one kind of
  experience, one culture, one nation, one body of art and literature as normative. All curriculums
  recognize a breath of identities, worldviews, and approaches.
- All members of the College community promote an on-campus environment that values equity and
  access of opportunity for all of its participants regardless of background, nationality, culture,
  religion, class, race, ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual orientation, and disability.

All Make School students, staff, and visitors are required to follow the tenets of the _Code of
Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_ in all Make School communities (i.e., on campus, online and on social
media, in student housing, etc.).
