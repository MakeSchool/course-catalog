# Student’s Rights, Responsibilities, and Addressing Grievances

All students are responsible for reviewing and upholding all of Make School’s policies as defined in
this Catalog. In an effort to promote a welcoming and safe learning environment for all community
members, students may report concerns or complaints at any time by completing the
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form). This form, and the information
provided in the form will remain private to the best of Make School’s ability. Depending upon the
nature of the complaint, anonymity may not be guaranteed, but we will do our best to protect the
privacy of all parties involved. Make School does not tolerate any form of retaliation. The form can
be used to report concerns regarding a violation of the
[Code of Conduct](/student-conduct-policies/code-of-conduct-equity-inclusion) or a concern regarding
the conduct of an instructor or staff member.

Complaints categories include:

- **Student Conduct**: Manager: Michelle Lessly Blackburn, Director of Student and Academic Affairs
- **Student-to-Faculty Complaints**: Manager: Anne Spalding, Dean and Interim President
- **Student-to-Staff Complaints**: Manager: Carmen Ye: Head of People, Culture, and JEDI
- **Title IX**: Manager: Carmen Ye: Title IX Coordinator
- **Financial Aid**: Manager: Director of Operations
- **Student-Facing Policies**: Manager: Michelle Lessly Blackburn, Director of Student and Academic
  Affairs
- **Academic Concerns**: Manager: Anne Spalding, Dean and Interim President

The student may also choose to speak with their instructor, coach, or a member of the Student
Experience Team to address the concern and complete the
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form) with the staff member or
instructor’s support. All concerns or complaints are addressed in a timely, private manner. Make
School staff may escalate the concern or complaint to the Dean or Director of Student and Academic
Affairs as appropriate.

The process for reporting, reviewing, and maintaining grievance records is as follows:

1. The student submits a written complaint via the
   [Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form).
2. The submission is reviewed by the Director of Student and Academic Affairs (Director) or their
   designee within one business day of the submission. The Director will follow-up with the student
   to confirm the complaint has been reviewed and provide next steps.
   1. Make School will first attempt to resolve the issue through a restorative justice process,
      however;
   2. Some complaints, depending on the nature of the report, will warrant an informal or formal
      resolution process as determined by the Director and described in the
      [Code of Conduct](/student-conduct-policies/code-of-conduct-equity-inclusion) policy.
   3. Complaints regarding a potential violation of Title IX, Hate Speech Policy, Retaliation, or
      Hazing are not eligible for the restorative justice process.
3. Through the support of the Director (student-related issues) or the Dean (instructor or
   staff-related issues), the parties involved will proceed through the designated process to
   resolve the issue.
   1. Most issues will be resolved through a Participation Improvement Plan (PIP).
4. If applicable, students may pursue the appeal process as described in the
   [Code of Conduct](/student-conduct-policies/code-of-conduct-equity-inclusion).
5. Records relating to the initial complaint, resolution process, and appeals will be maintained for
   up to seven years after the resolution of the incident. All records are
   [FERPA](/academic-and-educational-program-information/academic-policies) protected.
