# Community Policies

## Alcohol, Drug & Smoking

Smoking and the use of substances (alcohol or drugs), including marijuana and nicotine, is not
allowed on Make School’s campus and in the residence hall(s) or during online instruction or events.
All students and staff who wish to smoke any substance, or vape, must do so outdoors, following San
Francisco city ordinance which requires smokers to stand at least 20 feet from a building’s
entrance. It is also not permissible for a student to post imagery on social media accounts, which
depict the use of these substances while located on Make School property.

If it is determined that a student (online or on-campus) is under the influence of alcohol or drugs,
or has been smoking or vaping during an official Make School activity (including class), any related
contraband will be confiscated (if on-campus) and the standard
[Performance Improvement Plan](/student-conduct-policies/disciplinary-action-academic-conduct)
process will be followed.

## Communications Expectations

Students are expected to engage in professional conduct through all communication mediums with
students, staff, and instructors. Professional communication at Make School is defined as:

- Uses inclusive language, and is aligned with the Code of Conduct
- Open to discussion and free-flow of ideas
- Timely In both giving and receiving information

Learning how to professionally and effectively communicate is a key component of a student’s
educational experience at Make School. In addition to keeping staff and instructors up-to-date on
anything that may impact their ability to fully participate in the classroom or other school
activities, students are responsible for regularly checking their Make School email and Slack, and
responding to correspondence within one business day of outreach by instructors or staff.

Staff and instructors may reach out to a student when they are not attending class or are
participating in school activities to ensure the student is safe and/or well. It is an expectation
that students respond to a Make School employee when one attempts to contact them. A lack of
response, commonly referred to as “ghosting,” may lead to concern for the student’s health or
safety.

A student who consistently does not respond to instructors or staff may result in Make School
conducting wellness checks or reaching out to the student’s emergency contact to verify the
student’s safety and wellbeing.

## Disorderly Conduct

Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times. Make School
prohibits disorderly conduct, defined as: creating a public disturbance, issuing threats or taking
of violence against a person or groups, reckless behavior that creates an unsafe environment in the
classroom or living space, damage to a person’s property, conduct that interrupts or interferes with
the normal operation of Make School, student learning opportunities or Make School sponsored events
or activities that take place on or off campus.

## Family and Parental Notification

Make School is committed to fostering the holistic development of all students. Part of this
development process entails students being autonomous in their decision-making and thinking
critically about certain choices and actions. However, there are times when these choices and
actions pose a significant health risk to the student or endangers the welfare of the college
community. If a student chooses to act in a way that endangers themselves and/or puts the campus
community in harm’s way, Make School reserves the right to contact parents, guardians, or
student-designated emergency contacts to discuss concerns and explore possible resolutions (per the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974). In the event Make School contacts a student’s
family to address life or safety concerns, Make School will inform the student of the disclosure

## Hate Speech

Make School’s desire to foster a professional environment that honors the freedom of expression is
equally balanced with pursuit to create an inclusive living and learning environment. All members of
the Make School community are responsible for expressing themselves in a manner that is respectful
of others’ backgrounds, identities, and life experiences. This policy applies to all modes of
communication, including in-person, online (email, Slack, etc.), and visual media (memes, gifs,
etc.)

## Hazing

Make School prohibits all forms of Hazing. Not only is hazing a crime, it is antithetical to the
community values of Make School. For this reason, we take a strong stance against hazing, defined
as:

- Any behavior or action required to join or be considered a part of a student group, recognized or
  not recognized by Make School;
- The misuse of one’s authority as determined by their leadership position, age or classification;
- Causing physical, emotional, or mental harm to another person for the purpose of affiliating an
  individual to a community;
- Conditions set to continue be a member of a student group or community;
- “Traditions” that involve putting oneself or others at risk or engaging activities without one’s
  consent.
- **_Note: Conduct meeting the definition of hazing may occur online as well as in-person._**

### Reporting Hazing

If you have been hazed, have witnessed or are aware of behavior that may be considered hazing, you
must report the incident(s) to
the[ Director of Student and Academic Affairs](mailto:michelle.blackburn@makeschool.com) or use
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form). In the event the hazing activity
has put a student’s safety at risk or is an emergency, you should contact 911 to get emergency
medical attention.

Incidents of hazing are not eligible for an Informal Resolution of the
[Student Conduct Process](/student-conduct-policies/disciplinary-action-academic-conduct).

## Hazardous Materials

Make School may use chemicals and substances that require special handling, storage, deployment, and
disposal in our maintenance and cleaning functions. Federal regulations and our local OSHA
authorities require that the campus implement a Hazard Communication Program to alert our campus to
the presence of these substances and any potential risk of exposure. Should you see any procedures
that appear questionable, products in use whose properties you question, or the mishandling of a
chemical, please immediately bring the matter to the attention of the Operations Team. The sale,
manufacture, or unauthorized possession/maintenance of hazardous or toxic substances on Make School
property is prohibited.

## Medical Amnesty

Student health and safety are of primary concern at Make School. As such, in situations where there
is a medical emergency as a result of violation of policy (e.g., alcohol or drug use), Make School
encourages individuals to seek medical assistance for themselves or others. If an individual seeks
medical attention, Make School may not pursue student conduct sanctions against the student for
violations of these policies or the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_. Additionally, those
students who assist in obtaining medical attention for others may not receive sanctions for
violations of student policy or the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_. This policy does not
grant amnesty to those who are charged with possession and intent to distribute drugs.

This policy does not preclude sanctions due to any other violations of the _Code of Conduct, Equity
& Inclusion_ or student policy. Likewise, it does not prevent action by police or other law
enforcement personnel.

## Off-Campus Conduct

All students are expected to follow local, state and federal laws at all times. Make School may
determine, on a case-by-case basis, to address off-campus violations of local, state, and federal
through the student conduct process if the violation poses a health or safety risk to the Make
School community or is detrimental to the educational interest of others. Any student conduct
process will be independent from criminal proceedings and will not be impacted by the outcomes of
the legal process.

In the event off-campus conduct results in an arrest or criminal proceedings, students are
responsible for obtaining bail funding and legal counsel independently.

## Non-Retaliation

No individual shall be penalized in any way for having reported or threatened to report any
violation of procedure, policy, or non-compliance with the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_, or
for cooperating with or participating in any grievance investigation. Furthermore, no individual
shall be penalized for reporting incidents of discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct.
Retaliation by any member of the community against such an individual is prohibited, and shall be
considered a serious violation of Make School policy. Retaliation includes threats, intimidation,
reprisals, and any adverse actions related to an individual’s employment or Education.
