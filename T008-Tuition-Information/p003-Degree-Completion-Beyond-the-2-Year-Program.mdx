### Degree Completion Beyond the 2 Year Program

For students in Fall 2017 Cohort, given the program that students joined was not initially
accredited, students who need additional time to complete a degree have adjusted financial options.
No additional tuition will be charged for students completing their degree. Additionally, Make
School will reimburse students who take S&L courses off campus up to $500 per course with prior
approval. In order to receive the reimbursement, students must provide receipt of payment and proof
of passing the course. Reimbursable items include tuition, transportation, and course materials.
This can be sent to [financial.aid@makeschool.com](mailto:finance@makeschool.com).

For all other students (entering the program in Fall 2018 or later), if your degree plan extends
beyond two years, you can complete up to 12 additional credits without being charged if you have
maintained Satisfactory Academic Progress throughout your time at Make School. These 12 credits do
not include the SWE Internship and there is no charge for a SWE Internship taken in the post
two-year time period. Students needing more than 12 credits after the two-year time frame may need
to pay tuition for these credits and will need to consult with financial aid individually
