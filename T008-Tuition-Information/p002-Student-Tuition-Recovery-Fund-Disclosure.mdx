# Student Tuition Recovery Fund Disclosure

The State of California established the Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) to relieve or mitigate
economic loss suffered by a student in an educational program at a qualifying institution, who is or
was a California resident while enrolled, or was enrolled in a residency program, if the student
enrolled in the institution, prepaid tuition, and suffered economic loss. Unless relieved of the
obligation to do so, you must pay the state-imposed assessment for the STRF, or it must be paid on
your behalf, if you are a student in an educational program, who is a California resident, or are
enrolled in a residency program, and prepay all or part of your tuition. You are not eligible for
protection from the STRF and you are not required to pass the STRF assessment, if you are not a
California resident, or are not enrolled in a residency program.

It is important that you keep copies of your enrollment agreement, financial aid documents,
receipts, or any other information that documents the amount paid to the school. Questions regarding
the STRF may be directed to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, 2532 Capitol Oaks Drive,
Suite 400, Sacramento, CA 95833, (916) 431-6959 or (888) 370-7589.

To be eligible for STRF, you must be a California resident or are enrolled in a residency program,
prepaid tuition, paid or deemed to have paid the STRF assessment, and suffered an economic loss as a
result of any of the following:

1. The institution, a location of the institution, or an educational program offered by the
   institution was closed or discontinued, and you did not choose to participate in a teach-out plan
   approved by the Bureau or did not complete a chosen teach-out plan approved by the Bureau.

2. You were enrolled at an institution or a location of the institution within the 120 day period
   before the closure of the institution or location of the institution, or were enrolled in an
   educational program within the 120 day period before the program was discontinued.

3. You were enrolled at an institution or a location of the institution more than 120 days before
   the closure of the institution or location of the institution, in an educational program offered
   by the institution as to which the Bureau determined there was a significant decline in the
   quality or value of the program more than 120 days before closure.

4. The institution has been ordered to pay a refund by the Bureau but has failed to do so.

5. The institution has failed to pay or reimburse loan proceeds under a federal student loan program
   required by law, or has failed to pay or reimburse proceeds received by the institution in excess
   of tuition and other costs.

6. You have been awarded restitution, a refund, or other monetary award by an arbitrator or court,
   based on a violation of this chapter by an institution or representative of an institution, but
   have been unable to collect the award from the institution.

7. You sought legal counsel that resulted in the cancellation of one or more of your student loans
   and have an invoice for services rendered and evidence of the cancellation of the student loan or
   loans.

To qualify for STRF reimbursement, the application must be received within four (4) years from the
date of the action or event that made the student eligible for recovery from STRF.

A student whose loan is revived by a loan holder or debt collector after a period of non collection
may, at any time, file a written application for recovery from the STRF for the debt that would have
otherwise been eligible for recovery. If it has been more than four (4) years since the action or
event that made the student eligible, the student must have filed a written application for recovery
within the original four (4) year period, unless the period has been extended by another act or law.

However, no claim can be paid to any student without a social security number or a taxpayer
identification number.
