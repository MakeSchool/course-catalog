## Library Services

Make School maintains an online library with a curated list of digital resources for technical
content, social science texts, periodicals, reference materials, databases, and reserves to
supplement student learning. These resources can be accessed online at
[make.sc/library](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHqwZzGi88VJTB1IynMHgTrFzjN2GpIXS8cyOVwnTcQ/preview#heading=h.5ejfrtps59sw).

Students who reside in San Francisco may also utilize the **San Francisco Public Library** (SFPL).
The SFPL is an excellent source for supplemental learning materials, with a great system of
reserving books from any library in the SFPL system. Students may also utilize professional
librarian services through SFPL. The Main Library Branch is located at 100 Larkin Street, and is
just a brief walk from the Civic Center BART Station or a 20 minute walk from Make Schoolâ€™s campus.

Students receive training in the use of library resources during orientation in their first week of
classes. As necessary, students receive assignment-specific training from their instructors. Through
our partnership with Dominican University, students are able to access Library liaisons through the
student services webpage ([make.sc/du-self-service](make.sc/du-self-service)). Library liaisons are
subject specialists who provide support for student research by locating and recommending relevant
information and resources. Dominican University also subscribes to numerous online databases
containing scholarly articles, eBooks, newspapers, and many other resources designed to help
students with their research.
