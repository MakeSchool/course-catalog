## Communications Expectations 

Students are expected to engage in professional conduct through all communication mediums with students, staff, and instructors. Professional communication at Make School is defined as: 

* Uses inclusive language, and is aligned with the Code of Conduct

* Open to discussion and free-flow of ideas

* Timely In both giving and receiving information

Learning how to professionally and effectively communicate is a key component of a student’s educational experience at Make School. In addition to keeping staff and instructors up-to-date on anything that may impact their ability to fully participate in the classroom or other school activities, students are responsible for regularly checking their Make School email and Slack, and responding to correspondence within one business day of outreach by instructors or staff. 

Staff and instructors may reach out to a student when they are not attending class or are participating in school activities to ensure the student is safe and/or well. It is an expectation that students respond to a Make School employee when one attempts to contact them. A lack of response, commonly referred to as "ghosting," may lead to concern for the student’s health or safety.

A student who consistently does not respond to instructors or staff may result in Make School conducting wellness checks or reaching out to the student’s emergency contact to verify the student’s safety and wellbeing.
