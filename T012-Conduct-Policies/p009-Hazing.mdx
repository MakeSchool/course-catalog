## Hazing

Make School prohibits all forms of Hazing. Not only is hazing a crime, it is antithetical to the
community values of Make School. For this reason, we take a strong stance against hazing, defined
as:

- Any behavior or action required to join or be considered a part of a student group, recognized or
  not recognized by Make School;

- The misuse of one’s authority as determined by their leadership position, age or classification;

- Causing physical, emotional, or mental harm to another person for the purpose of affiliating an
  individual to a community;

- Conditions set to continue be a member of a student group or community;

- "Traditions" that involve putting oneself or others at risk or engaging activities without one’s
  consent.

Reporting Hazing

If you have been hazed, have witnessed or are aware of behavior that may be considered hazing, you
must report the incident(s) to
the[ Director of Student and Academic Affairs](mailto:michelle.blackburn@makeschool.com) or use
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form). In the event the hazing activity
has put a student’s safety at risk or is an emergency, you should contact 911 to get emergency
medical attention.

Incidents of hazing are not eligible for an Informal Resolution of the
[Student Conduct Process](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr).
