## Medical Amnesty

Student health and safety are of primary concern at Make School. As such, in situations where there
is a medical emergency as a result of violation of policy (e.g., alcohol or drug use), Make School
encourages individuals to seek medical assistance for themselves or others. If an individual seeks
medical attention, Make School may not pursue student conduct sanctions against the student for
violations of these policies or the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_. Additionally, those
students who assist in obtaining medical attention for others may not receive sanctions for
violations of student policy or the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_. This policy does not
grant amnesty to those who are charged with possession and intent to distribute drugs.

This policy does not preclude sanctions due to any other violations of the _Code of Conduct, Equity
& Inclusion_ or student policy. Likewise, it does not prevent action by police or other law
enforcement personnel.
