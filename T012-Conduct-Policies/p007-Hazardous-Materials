## Hazardous Materials

Make School may use chemicals and substances that require special handling, storage, deployment, and disposal in our maintenance and cleaning functions. Federal regulations and our local OSHA authorities require that the campus implement a Hazard Communication Program to alert our campus to the presence of these substances and any potential risk of exposure. Should you see any procedures that appear questionable, products in use whose properties you question, or the mishandling of a chemical, please immediately bring the matter to the attention of the Operations Team. The sale, manufacture, or unauthorized possession/maintenance of hazardous or toxic substances on Make School property is prohibited.
