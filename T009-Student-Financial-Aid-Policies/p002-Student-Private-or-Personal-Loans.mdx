# Student, Private, or Personal Loans

Private loans are an option for the students who need additional resources to attend college above
and beyond any federal or institutional aid they may have received. All loans carry the obligation
to repay the amount borrowed with interest and we encourage all students and families to borrow
responsibly.

If this is your first time learning about private loans, we strongly encourage you to review Make
Schoolâ€™s Tuition website before navigating to the private loan search options, specifically the
disclosures relating to federal student aid and the SB 1289 Disclosure Statement.

## Primer on Student Loans

- Most private loans are credit-based and may require a cosigner for the borrower to be approved.

- The interest rate can be variable or fixed. This rate may be higher or lower than the interest
  rate of a Federal Direct Loan.

- The maximum amount that can be borrowed, in most cases, cannot exceed the cost of attendance minus
  other financial aid.

- For students who have borrowed multiple private loans and/or federal loans, there are
  consolidation loans available. If considering consolidating federal loans into a private loan, pay
  attention to interest rates and there could be a loss of grace period and/or loan forgiveness
  options.

## Private Student Loan Search

Make School offers a comprehensive list to assist students and families the private loan options
available. THis list was compiled based on a thorough review of borrower benefits, customer service,
a request for information (RFI) process, other students using a lender or product, and/or other
factors. You are not required to select any of these lenders or products. Before borrowing a private
loan, we strongly recommend you maximize your Federal Direct Loan eligibility.
