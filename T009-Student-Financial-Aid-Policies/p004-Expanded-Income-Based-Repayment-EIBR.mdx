# Expanded Income-Based Repayment (EIBR)

Direct Federal Loans come with built-in Income-Based Repayment for students, resulting in payments
being capped at 10% of monthly discretionary income. This provides part of the protection for
underemployed and unemployed graduates. The problem we are solving is that all other student loans
(Parent Plus, Private) don’t come with built-in Income-Based repayments options. So while you could
reduce your Direct Federal Loan payments to $0 if you are unemployed, at other colleges you would
still have to pay monthly for the rest of your loans. Not so at Make School.

Make School is creating and funding an Extended Income-Based Repayment (EIBR) protection plan to
cover Parent Plus and [private loans](#heading=h.cvhmh8iudig) to create full protection for
underemployed and unemployed graduates.

The EIBR protection plan is designed as an extension of the Federal IBR program to apply to all
types of loans not covered by the Federal IBR and preserve the protection and incentive alignment of
previous payment plan options. The EIBR protection plan will cap total student loan payments
(combined federal, parent plus, and private) to the following percentages of monthly gross income.

| Graduate Annual Gross Income | EIBR Cap |
| :--------------------------: | :------: |
|            $60K+             |   20%    |
|           $50-59K            |   18%    |
|           $40-49K            |   15%    |
|           $30-39K            |   10%    |
|           $20-29K            |    6%    |
|           &lt;$20K           |    0%    |

_Disclaimer: the stated EIBR caps apply to students enrolling in Fall 2020. These caps are subject
to change by a few percentage points for future cohorts as we collect data on how the program is
working and what challenges surface._

Any debt obligation beyond the cap will be paid out by the EIBR protection plan. The EIBR protection
plan is funded by 10% of tuition revenue collected by Make School, placed into a protected fund with
transparent financials and independent control. Make School itself is a guarantor for the fund and
will top it up if ever necessary.

We expect that around 80% of students will qualify for the cheaper funding options, government and
private loans, to fund their Make School education. For those who don’t, we still plan on offering
tuition gap funding. To receive tuition gap funding, students will be required to apply for these
new funding options first\*.

\* **If you have significant existing debt that would result in unaffordable monthly payments after
Make School, you may be denied for both loans and tuition gap funding. Please contact us immediately
at [admissions@makeschool.com](mailto:admissions@makeschool.com) if you have more than $7,500 in
outstanding debt. This is not a hard cut-off, just an amount that will trigger a conversation about
the best financial options for you.**
