# Campus Access Policy

Make School is open during typical business operating hours (Monday through Friday, 9:00am to
6:00pm). Students have access to campus from 8:00am-8:30pm Monday through Friday and 9:00am-8:00pm
Saturday and Sunday. There may be occasional evening and weekend events hosted by Make School or
other companies on campus. All events will have assigned student “Openers” and “Closers,” who are
trained on alarm codes and building safety precautions. Events will also have an identified Make
School staff member to be “on call” in case of emergency.

## Guest Access

Make School is open to current and prospective students, as well as guests. Guests and visitors are
welcome to visit the campus during normal business operating hours (Monday through Friday, 8:00am to
8:30pm), but must check in upon entry. Guests are also welcome to attend any Make School event that
is open to the public. Please note that students are responsible for the actions and behaviors of
their on-campus guests at all times.

## Conference Rooms

The campus conference rooms are prioritized for use by Make School staff. Students are encouraged to
work in the open space work environment to learn from one another and better collaborate. If a
student needs to use a conference room, they will need to reserve the room through a Make School
staff member.

## Shared Work Spaces

Make School is a shared open space work environment, which means it is especially important to
respect everyone’s physical space and be cognizant of your surroundings. Respectful action includes
being quiet in designated quiet areas to allow fellow students to focus, and sharing Make
School-owned equipment when necessary. Moreover, It is everyone’s responsibility to keep the space
clean and uncluttered.

## Kitchen

The kitchen is a shared space for all students and staff. All members must clean up after themselves
immediately when using the kitchen, which includes: putting dishes in the dishwasher, picking up all
trash, wiping up any surfaces used, and cleaning up any trash or debris on the floor. If students
store food in the kitchen, they must abide by the Food Storage Policy posted on the refrigerator.
Per this policy, all students must:

1. Label all stored food with their name and initial date of storage.
2. Remove any of the week’s food items from the refrigerator by 5:00pm on Friday.
3. Be respectful of others by consuming only your food items or community-specified items.
