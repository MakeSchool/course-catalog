# Student Identification Card Policy

All on-campus Make School students are expected to obtain a Student ID Card, which includes a
photograph and student identification number, from the Student Experience Team. Because this ID Card
doubles as the key that provides access to campus, it is especially important that students carry
their card with them at all times!

If a student happens to lose their ID card, they must contact the
[Operations Team](mailto:eric@makeschool.org) to secure a new one. When the new card is issued, the
previous card will be deactivated and the student requesting the card will be charged a $10
replacement fee.

If a student leaves Make School in good academic and behavioral standing, they can continue using
this ID card to access the building and community. If a student leaves and is not in good standing,
their card is deactivated and they are not invited to continue engaging with the Make School
community.
