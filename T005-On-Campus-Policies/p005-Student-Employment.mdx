# Student Employment

We have a number of paid, student worker opportunities available throughout the academic year for
both on-campus and online students. In order to enable as many students as possible the opportunity
for employment at Make School, students are only permitted to hold one paid position at a time.

To qualify for a paid student worker position, you must meet the following criteria:

- Be in good academic standing (not on an active academic PIP when starting the position)
  - If you are put on a PIP while employed as a student worker, you will be given 1 term to improve.
    You, your coach, and your supervisor will need to work together to create a success plan.
  - If criteria are not met by the end of the term, then you will be no longer eligible for a paid
    student worker position.
- Be in good conduct standing (not on an active behavioral PIP)
  - If you do need an behavioral PIP during your employment, your ability to continue in your role
    may be included in the PIPâ€™s sanctions or outcomes.
- Not be currently employed by Make School or willing to end one paid position to transfer to a new
  role.
- Authorized to work in the U.S. and present documentation confirming employment eligibility status
  to complete an I-9.

Student job opportunities will be posted online as positions become available. All student jobs
descriptions must follow these expectations:

- Work not to exceed more than 10 hours per week;
- Pay may exceed but cannot be less than the minimum wage set by the City of San Francisco,
  regardless of where the student resides;
- The role must be related to the academic program or operations of the School;
- The role must have a predetermined length of employment that may be extended if the work is needed
  and the student has met expectations during their most recent performance evaluation period;
- Student employees must be evaluated on their performance on a semesterly basis to determine if
  they should continue in the role.
