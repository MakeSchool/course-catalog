### The History of Make School

Make School was founded in 2012, initially as a Summer Academy, to introduce high school and college
students to the potential of using technology to solve problems. The program was designed to be
project-based and collaborative, focused on teaching students to use modern software development
tools and frameworks. The Summer Academy taught thousands of students from around the world how to
build products, and enabled students to earn internships and jobs at top tech companies.

In 2014, Make School began building a new college based on the same principles. In just five short
years, we laid a strong foundation that has aimed to improve the relevance of higher education and
help address the growing student debt crisis. Our alumni have gone on to work at companies like
Google, Facebook, Tesla and dozens of other tech companies, putting our outcomes on par with top
universities. We’re excited to continue evolving over the next five years, actively diversifying the
tech industry, innovating ways to improve the college model, and sharing what we learn with more
institutions of higher education.

In late 2020, Make School became a 501c(3) non-for-profit academic institution and was granted
Eligibility Status by WASC Senior College and University Commission to become an independently
accredited school.

can also take on the role of Industry Contacts (or Mentors) as you progress in your career. You are
encouraged to join the Alumni Slack channel and reach out to alumni for support, advice, and
networking opportunities. Once you graduate from Make School, remember that your engagement
continues within the alumni community. You’ll have the opportunity to attend alumni community

School Student, you will be provided continuous coaching and job support as an alumnus, courtesy of
our Student Career Services!

### Campus Recreation

Make School’s on-campus experience includes a variety of recreational activities for students,
faculty, and staff. Some regular on-campus recreational activities include:

- A **Ping Pong Table** is available for student use. If you’re especially competitive, you can even
  partake in the student-run Ping Pong Tournaments!

street fairs, concerts, and free activities! Here’s a list of
[Fun in San Francisco](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q3j9ChRX7JUbRMXkycC-rhboHs1rEdvowSGu4CR3on4/preview)!

#### Virtual Campus Recreation

hangouts, club meetings, coffee breaks, and game nights! If you have an interest in hosting an event
or starting a club, we encourage you to reach out to the Student Experience Team to get started!

### Career, Internship, and Job Placement Services

Make School provides Career Services to assist current students and graduates in developing job
search skills such as resume and cover letter development, interviewing skills, and appropriate
interview follow-up activities. Make School organizes career-preparation events including talks,
networking events, career fairs, and demo days with industry members to broaden students’
professional networks and increase their access to potential employers. During their time at Make
School, students have the ability to participate in on-site visits to local potential employers, and
build an online portfolio to be showcased during recruitment opportunities. We encourage students to
utilize platforms such as Handshake and join the Make School Connect group on LinkedIn. Make School
also makes personal introductions to recruiters and companies for well-qualified students seeking
internships and full-time employment.

### Coaching

Countless innovators have coaches. All students are assigned a coach and you will meet 1:1
throughout your time at Make School. Your coach’s sole purpose is to support you. Their job is not
to tell you what to do, but to let you lead the session, help you strategize flawlessly for
yourself, tease out what you want and need, and tap into your talents and the resources available to
you. We believe that you have everything you need to be successful: work ethic, creativity, drive.
Your coach is here to be your advocate and thought partner.

### Childcare

Make School does not provide childcare, but for students located in the Bay Area, the
[Children’s Council](http://www.childrenscouncil.org/) can help. Please visit their website to see
the childcare services they offer. Online students should explore local childcare options or visit
[Care.com](care.com) for childcare options.

### Health Insurance

Make School does not provide health insurance but all students are expected to have health
insurance. Because healthcare costs can become quite expensive, having an adequate plan that is
accepted by local providers is very important. If you are located in California, you can apply for
free healthcare via [Covered California](https://www.coveredca.com/medi-cal/). If you need
healthcare coverage but not based in California, you can purchase health insurance through your
state’s healthcare exchange or visit [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov). **Please note:
Students without health insurance may incur fees with the IRS for lack of coverage.**

In addition to requiring medical insurance, we also require the following
[history and immunization form](https://make.sc/makeschool_medicalforms) to be completed by all
students:

All completed forms must be submitted to the Admissions Office upon initial enrollment.

### Hospitals & Clinics

### Library Services

Make School maintains an online library with a curated list of digital resources for technical
content, social science texts, periodicals, reference materials, databases, and reserves to
supplement student learning. These resources can be accessed online at
[make.sc/library](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHqwZzGi88VJTB1IynMHgTrFzjN2GpIXS8cyOVwnTcQ/preview#heading=h.5ejfrtps59sw).

Students who reside in San Francisco may also utilize the **San Francisco Public Library** (SFPL).
The SFPL is an excellent source for supplemental learning materials, with a great system of
reserving books from any library in the SFPL system. Students may also utilize professional
librarian services through SFPL. The Main Library Branch is located at 100 Larkin Street, and is
just a brief walk from the Civic Center BART Station or a 20 minute walk from Make School’s campus.

Students enrolled in the online program may also use their public library as a source for
supplemental learning materials, professional librarian services, and interlibrary loans.

Regardless if you are online or on-campus you will receive training in the use of library resources
during orientation in your first week of classes. As necessary, you will receive assignment-specific
training from their instructors. Through our partnership with Dominican University, all students are
able to access Library liaisons through the student services webpage
([make.sc/du-self-service](http://make.sc/du-self-service)). Library liaisons are subject
specialists who provide support for your research by locating and recommending relevant information
and resources. Dominican University also subscribes to numerous online databases containing
scholarly articles, eBooks, newspapers, and many other resources designed to help students with
their research.

### Lost and Found

If you lost something while on-camps at Make School, it is best to check the Lost and Found bin
located in the Student Resource Room. If you cannot locate your item(s), or if you want to report
adding an item to the Lost and Found bin, you can message the #lost-and-found Slack channel. The
Lost and Found bin will be cleared monthly.

### Mental Health & Wellbeing

We know your mental health and physical wellbeing is an important component of your success at Make
School. We provide regular programming through events like Wellness Wendesays to help you stay
healthy and focused. This mental health programming is available for both online and on-campus
students; however, on-campus students may have access to additional in-person support or fitness
activities.

To support your mental health, Make School partners with [Better Help](http://betterhelp.com), an
online, on-demand licensed mental health counseling service, and these services are available to
both on-campus and online students.. You will receive unique log-in credentials upon your enrollment
of your first term at Make School and are able to use these services at no cost. You are
automatically given access to BetterHelp when you first enroll at Make School and is available to
you throughout your time at Make School. Graduates may receive an additional 6 months of services
upon request. BetterHelp is 100% confidential and what you share with your counselor will not be
shared with Make School. Both online and on-campus students have unlimited access to
[BetterHelp](betterhelp.com).

If your log-in expires, please contact Lisa Tran at
[lisa.tran@makeschool.com](mailto:lisa.tran@makeschool.com). You can contact Lisa for additional
support or information about BetterHelp.

Students can also review a comprehensive list of mental health resources at
[make.sc/mental-health-resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ONyKidX-a9HCrGVqA0c7JHMSWb85gUjFJlRx5sb9GFE/edit).

### Parking & Transportation for On-Campus Students

Make School is located in the heart of San Francisco, so parking is limited to city parking lots and
metered street parking. Students and visitors are encouraged to take public transport to campus.
Public transit is, by far, the easiest way of navigating the bay area. The basic forms of
transportation are, as follows:

- **AC Transit:** This is an Oakland-based public transit agency serving the western portions of
  Alameda and Contra Costa counties in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. AC Transit also
  operates "Transbay" routes across San Francisco Bay to San Francisco and selected areas in San
  Mateo and Santa Clara counties.
- **Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART):** This is a rapid transit public transportation system serving
  the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The heavy rail elevated and subway system connects San
  Francisco and Oakland with urban and suburban areas in Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Mateo
  counties.
- **CalTrain:** This is a California commuter rail line on the San Francisco Peninsula and in the
  Santa Clara Valley. The northern terminus of the line is in San Francisco at 4th and King streets;
  its southern terminus is in Gilroy.
- **The San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI):** This is the public transit system for the city and
  county of San Francisco, California. This includes the cable car system, the internal ‘subway’
  system that navigates San Francisco, and buses.

#### Clipper Card

We recommend that you invest in a [Clipper Card](https://www.clippercard.com/), which simplifies
paying for public transit by allowing you to reload funds automatically and online. It can also save
you money! For example, if you opt to automatically reload a High Value Discount ticket for Bay Area
Rapid Transit (BART), you receive a 6.25% discount per ride. There are also monthly Muni passes for
San Francisco fares, and the option of adding general cash value to your Clipper Card. Please note
that loading BART funds onto your account will not allow you to use other forms of public
transportation; you will have to load additional funds onto your Clipper Card to access additional
modes of travel.

### Student Groups

We empower and encourage students to initiate leadership and ownership over clubs. Since each cohort
is unique, we let student voices be heard and support their goals rather than determining standard
clubs. In this way, clubs are inspired and self-formed by the community and its members. Previous
cohorts have organized a Drone Club, Hackathon Club, and Women in Tech Club. Make School staff
members with expertise and/or interest in an area can serve as guides and resources to support
student clubs. All students, regardless if they are enrolled in the online or the on-campus program
are encouraged to participate in student groups and are eligible for leadership opportunities.

#### Student Council

Student Council is a Make School-sponsored group that consists of student advocates, nominated and
elected by their peers, who act as the voice of the student body. Student Council members
representatives include both online and on-campus students. The council has weekly meetings with the
Student Experience team to ensure students are happy, heard, and aware of the efforts employed to
support their life here at Make School. The members of the Student Council have the role of
listening to student concerns, and communicating these concerns to Make School staff. Student
Council is granted a budget and can plan student events in collaboration with the Student Experience
team.

#### Student Clubs

Students have the opportunity to start and lead clubs at Make School based on their interests.
Leading a club is also a great way to gain some professional development and leadership skills. Some
examples of clubs include the Data Science Club, Technical Interview Club, and Dungeons & Dragons
Club.

#### Peer Mentors

Peer Mentors are senior level students who have volunteered their time to help first-year students
transition to Make School. They can provide support with coursework, job/internship preparation, and
general adjustment to the Make School community.

#### Student Event Coordinators

We encourage students to help organize school-related gatherings! Students who express an interest
in this role volunteer to meet bi-weekly with the Student Experience Team to plan and organize
monthly events for the student body and staff. Events include holiday celebrations, multicultural
day meals, talent shows, spring flings, and other school-sponsored functions.

#### Student JEDI Committee

Students are welcome to participate in developing initiatives to support a diverse student
population. The student-led JEDI Committee (Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion) works with the
Student Experience team to host educational programs, trainings, and events to help foster a
welcoming and inclusive environment for all community members.

## Technology Information

### Etiquette

We expect all students to conduct themselves in a respectful, inclusive manner when communicating
online, over Zoom, and through social media.

When engaging with others over Zoom or other conferencing programs, you should

- Keep your camera on, if possible;
- Mute yourself unless you are speaking;
- Come to class on time, and check in using the attendance short-link/code/QR code;
- Be mindful of your video/screen sharing. Make sure it is something you wouldn’t mind all your
  peers and instructors seeing

### Information Technology

Information Technology is a key component to students’ success at Make School. You will need to set
up the following accounts:

#### GSuite Account

All Make School students will receive an official Make School email address, which should be used
for all communication while you’re a student. This email address will be your legal first name, a
period, and your legal last name, followed by @students.makeschool.com (e.g.,
john.doe@students.makeschool.com). This account is part of the Google Suite, which also gives access
to all administrative Google interfaces (i.e., Google Drive, Google Docs, etc.).

#### Gradescope Account

[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) is an assignment submission, grading, and analytics
platform that allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will
be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.
As soon as grades are posted, you will receive an email notification so that you can log in and see
your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.** Note:
Final grades are posted on your Dashboard on the Make School Student Portal and not in Gradescope.**

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at
[https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be
used if you need to set your password for the first time.

#### GitHub Account

[GitHub](https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/) is our Learning Management System for the
technical courses at Make School. Be sure to register for an account prior to your first day of
classes. Make School also uses GitHub to announce important information relating to the school. It
is your responsibility to check GitHub for these updates.

#### Slack Account

[Slack](http://slack.com) is the main platform Make School uses for informal communication.
Announcements, reminders about action items, and community conversations are shared via this
service. It is important that you are attentive to your Slack channels and messages, as this is
often the fastest way to share information with colleagues and Make School staff. Students are
automatically invited to Slack upon enrollment. To access the student Slack workspace on your
computer or mobile device, open the email invitation sent to your Make School email account and
click “join.” Slack will then guide you through the process of setting up your account.

#### Social Media Accounts

Make School has a robust [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/makeschool/),
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/make_school/?hl=en), and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/makeschool/) network! **Facebook** is used to enhance
internal communications among the Make School community. You can join the following Make School
groups on Facebook:

- [Make School Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MakeSchoolCommunity/)
- [Make School ](https://www.facebook.com/makeschool/)
- [Make School Women](https://www.facebook.com/groups/916655231787097/)

**LinkedIn** is a tool to connect internally with staff and students, as well as externally with
hiring partners, industry contacts, and other Make School affiliates. It is highly encouraged for
you to add connections and utilize this platform. LinkedIn is the number one way recruits reach out
to you when looking to hire, and it’s important that your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date with your
current projects, experience and education, and a professional headshot. We provide support to
students to create an effective LinkedIn profile, and we encourage students to join the Make School
Connect Group on LinkedIn to increase their network and develop connections in industry.

### Laptops

Every student must have a fully-operating laptop on which to do their work. The minimum laptop
requirements are, as follows:

- An Apple Laptop
- At least 8 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM)
- At least 100 GB of Solid State Drive (SSD) Storage
- A fully-functioning keyboard and screen and a battery that holds a charge
- A fully-functioning webcam and microphone (both online and on-campus students)
- An operating system supported by
  [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-requirements-for-Windows-macOS-and-Linux).

Since purchasing a laptop can be a large financial burden, we can provide advice for how to find an
economical laptop that will serve you well. Some simple tips are:

- **Upgrade:** If you have an older Apple laptop that lacks SSD storage, you can check if your
  laptop is upgradeable with a new SSD storage component and more memory. If so, the most economical
  option is to purchase an SSD storage and RAM, then install them in your laptop.
- **Buy Used:** Many websites, including Craigslist and eBay, offer less expensive used laptop
  options. When buying a computer through a reseller, confirm with the seller that the laptop is
  fully functioning and that the computer is in decent operating condition. It is especially
  important to focus on the battery, charging cables, keyboard, screen, and USB ports.
- **Buy Refurbished:** You can buy a refurbished MacBook Air for approximately $900. If you combine
  this with a financing option, you may only need to pay approx. $75/month for 12 months.
- **Buy with Apple or Retail Financing:** Apple and other retail stores often offer financial
  options to allow you to pay for a computer over 12 months with no interest.

#### Temporary Laptop Assistance

We understand how important it is to have a properly functioning laptop in order to be effective at
Make School. Students are responsible for securing a temporary laptop in the event that their
current laptop is inoperable and needs to be repaired. Make School may be able to assist students
with the cost associated with renting a laptop. For more information regarding temporary laptop
assistance, contact [student.affairs@makeschool.com](mailto:student.affairs@makeschool.com).

### Online Learning Tutorial

You should review the
[Online Learning Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tls-1j9nAx0qw8SnINuEn_q4nm0QWY5s5FhZsVBs_DQ/edit#heading=h.cl51njq0mka)
to learn tips and tricks to taking classes online, as well as Make School’s expectations for how you
will engage with instructors and peers when online.

This comprehensive guide will help you set-up your environment, learn how to navigate your student
dashboard, access course materials on GitHub, and utilize GSuite. We recommend that you review this
document and set-up your environment prior to the start of the term.

## Student Conduct Policies

### Student Conduct Policies Overview

The policies described in this section of the Catalog are especially important for students to
understand, as violating these policies may result in the
[Formal Resolution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1i2jwXqx__URpWvUf8z8E9iwcdJ05QsPnbjs7Z83Us/edit#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr)
process. Students are expected to follow these policies at all times. Reports regarding potential
violations of these conduct policies can be submitted using the
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form). All policies and processes are
applicable to both online and on-campus students.

### Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion

Make School nurtures attitudes and behaviors that promote global awareness, inclusivity, and respect
for the dignity of each person regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age,
socioeconomic status, culture, political conviction, religion, or disability.

We are committed to creating an environment in which every individual can work, study, and live
without feeling excluded, unsafe, or harassed. As such, we encourage speech and actions that support
this mission and the identities of our community members, thus emboldening us to thrive as both a
community and as individuals.

You will see our commitment to these tenets at play in our academics in the following ways:

- All members of the College community consider diversity constructively in all planning, policy,
  decision-making, procedural, academic, and administrative operations throughout the College.
- All course curriculum content, pedagogy, syllabi structure, assignments, grading, and learning
  outcomes are built to ensure it does not marginalize identities or implicitly identify one kind of
  experience, one culture, one nation, one body of art and literature as normative. All curriculums
  recognize a breath of identities, worldviews, and approaches.
- All members of the College community promote an on-campus environment that values equity and
  access of opportunity for all of its participants regardless of background, nationality, culture,
  religion, class, race, ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual orientation, and disability.

All Make School students, staff, and visitors are required to follow the tenets of the _Code of
Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_ in all Make School communities (i.e., on campus, online and on social
media, in student housing, etc.).

### Disciplinary Action: Academic & Conduct

This section of the Catalog outlines resolution of policy violations, whether academic or
conduct-related.

#### Informal Resolution Processes

Informal Resolution is used when the parties agree to resolve interpersonal conflicts or a violation
of the Code of Conduct through conflict resolution (mediation, restorative justice, etc.), or where
the responding party accepts responsibility for violating policy, or when the Dean, Director of
Student and Academic Affairs, or their representative, can resolve the matter informally by
providing remedies to resolve the situation. In any case, the Dean, Director, or their
representative will determine if Informal Resolution will be an option.

It is not necessary to pursue Informal Resolution first in order to pursue Formal Resolution, and
any party participating in Informal Resolution can stop the process at any time and request the
Formal Resolution process., If an Informal Resolution fails after the fact, Formal Resolution may be
pursued (see below).

_PLEASE NOTE: Significant or egregious violations of policies or procedures may not be eligible for
Informal Resolution (as determined by the Dean or Director). Reports of violations of the
Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, or Retalation Policy will be addressed through the
Formal Resoltuion Process._

#### Verbal or Written Warnings

Informal Resolutions may include a verbal or written warning from the Dean or the Director of
Student and Academic Affairs. These warnings serve as notice to the student of the violation of the
Code of Conduct and function as a record of the behavior. Verbal or Written Warnings are an interim
measure prior to a Performance Improvement Plan.

#### Formal Resolutions: Performance Improvement Plans

When a student is alleged to have violated academic or behavioral policy at Make School, the matter
must be reported to and investigated by the appropriate conduct administrator. In most cases, the
administrator will be the Dean or the Director of Student and Academic Affairs, but can also be
their designee.

The investigation process typically consists of the following (not necessarily in this order):

- Written notification to the student (via email) of the alleged violation of policy;
- An interview with the parties involved in the alleged violation, and any witnesses who may have
  knowledge of the incident or who can provide additional information;
- A summary of the evidence gathered that is shared with the student alleged to have violated
  policy.
- A determination of factual findings and notification of appropriate sanctions and/or follow-up
  action.

Once the investigation is complete and the student has been notified of the violated policy, the
Conduct Administrator will initiate a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) except in cases where
Alternate Conduct Action is required as noted below.

A PIP is a specific plan developed on an individual basis to set clearly articulated goals or
objectives to improve performance. It includes check-ins, transparent expectations, and closely
monitored progress by the conduct administrator and the student’s coach. There are two types of PIPs
based on the type of policy violation: behavioural or academic:

- A **Conduct PIP** issued for Conduct Violations listed in this Course Catalog & Student Handbook.
- An **Academic PIP** is issued for either academic violations listed in the Course Catalog &
  Student Handbook, or when a student is not making Satisfactory Academic Progress.

While on a PIP, a student may be considered not to be in good standing and may have certain
restrictions related to their participation in select programming and events. Examples include, but
not limited to, field trips, mock technical interviews, access to new industry contacts, student
jobs (i.e., Teaching or Resident Assistantships), participation in Student Council, and outcomes
referrals to partner companies. Any such restrictions will be noted in the PIP.

A PIP typically is in effect for a specific time period (usually 30 days) and the student
performance will be re-evaluated at the end of that time period. If a PIP does not result in the
student meeting the goals or objectives, the student may be dismissed or suspended from Make School
either immediately or at the end of the term as denoted in the PIP. Typically, a dismissed student
is not allowed to return to Make School, and a suspended student may be allowed to return by
reapplying the following year.

TK_FIX link to section Refer to [Academic Dismissal](#heading=h.jqenqokn9vth) section for more
information.

**Alternate Conduct Action:** Reports of violations of certain policies (i.e., violations of Sexual
Misconduct policies or violation of the Alcohol, Drug & Smoking Policies) may require alternate
conduct action.

#### Request for Appeal of Conduct Action

A request for an appeal of the findings and/or sanctions is subject to the grounds outlined below.
All original sanctions imposed remain in effect through determination of the appeal, and both
parties should be timely informed of the status of the request for appeal, the status of the appeal
consideration, and the result of the appeal decision. Requests for Appeal must be submitted in
writing to the Dean of Make School within five (5) business days of receipt of the
findings/sanctions being issued.

Appeal requests are limited to the following grounds:

- A procedural or substantive error occurred that significantly impacted the outcome of the hearing
  (e.g. substantiated bias, material deviation from established procedures, etc.). A summary
  explaining the error must be included with the request for an appeal.
- To consider new evidence,unavailable during the original hearing or investigation, that could
  substantially impact the original finding or sanction. A summary of this new evidence and its
  potential impact must be included with the request for appeal.
- The sanctions imposed are substantially outside the parameters or guidelines set by the University
  for this type of offense or the cumulative conduct record of the responding party. A summary
  explaining the disproportion of the sanctions must be included with the request for an appeal.

Upon receipt of the Request for Appeal, the Dean will designate an Appellate Officer who will
consider the appeal request and all submitted summaries, evaluate the merit of a request for an
appeal in light of the circumstances and the Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion, and make a
determination on whether enough information exists to warrant an appeal review.

If an Appeal Review is Denied: the finding/sanction stands as-is.

If an Appeal Review is Granted: the Appellate Officer will engage in a thorough review of the appeal
request (including the submitted summaries), the original record (including the investigator’s
report), and any other relevant information, and will take one or a combination of the following
actions:

- Uphold the findings and/or sanctions outlined in the Administrative Disposition;
- Modify the findings and/or sanctions outlined in the Administrative Disposition;
- Dismiss the findings and/or sanctions outlined in the Administrative Disposition.

The decision of the Appellate Officer will be considered final and binding for all parties involved.

### Student’s Rights, Responsibilities, and Addressing Grievances

All students are responsible for reviewing and upholding all of Make School’s policies as defined in
this Catalog. In an effort to promote a welcoming and safe learning environment for all community
members, students may report concerns or complaints at any time by completing the
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form). This form, and the information
provided in the form will remain private to the best of Make School’s ability. Depending upon the
nature of the complaint, anonymity may not be guaranteed, but we will do our best to protect the
privacy of all parties involved. Make School does not tolerate any form of retaliation. The form can
be used to report concerns regarding a violation of the

TK_FIX link code of conduct [Code of Conduct](#heading=h.x0jvq6l5kdwl) or a concern regarding the
conduct of an instructor or staff member.

Complaints categories include:

- **Student Conduct**: Manager: Michelle Lessly Blackburn, Director of Student and Academic Affairs
- **Student-to-Faculty Complaints**: Manager: Anne Spalding, Dean and Interim President
- **Student-to-Staff Complaints**: Manager: Carmen Ye: Head of People, Culture, and JEDI
- **Title IX**: Manager: Carmen Ye: Title IX Coordinator
- **Financial Aid**: Manager: Director of Operations
- **Student-Facing Policies**: Manager: Michelle Lessly Blackburn, Director of Student and Academic
  Affairs
- **Academic Concerns**: Manager: Anne Spalding, Dean and Interim President

The student may also choose to speak with their instructor, coach, or a member of the Student
Experience Team to address the concern and complete
the[ Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form) with the staff member or
instructor’s support. All concerns or complaints are addressed in a timely, private manner. Make
School staff may escalate the concern or complaint to the Dean or Director of Student and Academic
Affairs as appropriate.

The process for reporting, reviewing, and maintaining grievance records is as follows:

1. The student submits a written complaint via the
   [Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form).
2. The submission is reviewed by the Director of Student and Academic Affairs (Director) or their
   designee within one business day of the submission. The Director will follow-up with the student
   to confirm the complaint has been reviewed and provide next steps.
   1. Make School will first attempt to resolve the issue through a restorative justice process,
      however;
   2. Some complaints, depending on the nature of the report, will warrant an informal or formal
      resolution process as determined by the Director and described in the
      [Code of Conduct](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr) policy. TK_FIX link code of conduct
   3. Complaints regarding a potential violation of Title IX, Hate Speech Policy, Retaliation, or
      Hazing are not eligible for the restorative justice process.
3. Through the support of the Director (student-related issues) or the Dean (instructor or
   staff-related issues), the parties involved will proceed through the designated process to
   resolve the issue.
   1. Most issues will be resolved through a Participation Improvement Plan (PIP).
4. If applicable, students may pursue the appeal process as described in the
   [Code of Conduct](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr). TK_FIX link code of conduct
5. Records relating to the initial complaint, resolution process, and appeals will be maintained for
   up to seven years after the resolution of the incident. All records are
   [FERPA](#heading=h.lcouv21rq30j) protected. TK_FIX link ferpa

### Community Policies

#### Alcohol, Drug & Smoking

Smoking and the use of substances (alcohol or drugs), including marijuana and nicotine, is not
allowed on Make School’s campus and in the residence hall(s) or during online instruction or events.
All students and staff who wish to smoke any substance, or vape, must do so outdoors, following San
Francisco city ordinance which requires smokers to stand at least 20 feet from a building’s
entrance. It is also not permissible for a student to post imagery on social media accounts, which
depict the use of these substances while located on Make School property.

If it is determined that a student (online or on-campus) is under the influence of alcohol or drugs,
or has been smoking or vaping during an official Make School activity (including class), any related
contraband will be confiscated (if on-campus) and the standard
[Performance Improvement Plan](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr) process will be followed. TK_FIX link pip
process

#### Communications Expectations

Students are expected to engage in professional conduct through all communication mediums with
students, staff, and instructors. Professional communication at Make School is defined as:

- Uses inclusive language, and is aligned with the Code of Conduct
- Open to discussion and free-flow of ideas
- Timely In both giving and receiving information

Learning how to professionally and effectively communicate is a key component of a student’s
educational experience at Make School. In addition to keeping staff and instructors up-to-date on
anything that may impact their ability to fully participate in the classroom or other school
activities, students are responsible for regularly checking their Make School email and Slack, and
responding to correspondence within one business day of outreach by instructors or staff.

Staff and instructors may reach out to a student when they are not attending class or are
participating in school activities to ensure the student is safe and/or well. It is an expectation
that students respond to a Make School employee when one attempts to contact them. A lack of
response, commonly referred to as “ghosting,” may lead to concern for the student’s health or
safety.

A student who consistently does not respond to instructors or staff may result in Make School
conducting wellness checks or reaching out to the student’s emergency contact to verify the
student’s safety and wellbeing.

#### Disorderly Conduct

Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times. Make School
prohibits disorderly conduct, defined as: creating a public disturbance, issuing threats or taking
of violence against a person or groups, reckless behavior that creates an unsafe environment in the
classroom or living space, damage to a person’s property, conduct that interrupts or interferes with
the normal operation of Make School, student learning opportunities or Make School sponsored events
or activities that take place on or off campus.

#### Family and Parental Notification

Make School is committed to fostering the holistic development of all students. Part of this
development process entails students being autonomous in their decision-making and thinking
critically about certain choices and actions. However, there are times when these choices and
actions pose a significant health risk to the student or endangers the welfare of the college
community. If a student chooses to act in a way that endangers themselves and/or puts the campus
community in harm’s way, Make School reserves the right to contact parents, guardians, or
student-designated emergency contacts to discuss concerns and explore possible resolutions (per the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974). In the event Make School contacts a student’s
family to address life or safety concerns, Make School will inform the student of the disclosure

#### Hate Speech

Make School’s desire to foster a professional environment that honors the freedom of expression is
equally balanced with pursuit to create an inclusive living and learning environment. All members of
the Make School community are responsible for expressing themselves in a manner that is respectful
of others’ backgrounds, identities, and life experiences. This policy applies to all modes of
communication, including in-person, online (email, Slack, etc.), and visual media (memes, gifs,
etc.)

#### Hazing

Make School prohibits all forms of Hazing. Not only is hazing a crime, it is antithetical to the
community values of Make School. For this reason, we take a strong stance against hazing, defined
as:

- Any behavior or action required to join or be considered a part of a student group, recognized or
  not recognized by Make School;
- The misuse of one’s authority as determined by their leadership position, age or classification;
- Causing physical, emotional, or mental harm to another person for the purpose of affiliating an
  individual to a community;
- Conditions set to continue be a member of a student group or community;
- “Traditions” that involve putting oneself or others at risk or engaging activities without one’s
  consent.
- **_Note: Conduct meeting the definition of hazing may occur online as well as in-person._**

##### Reporting Hazing

If you have been hazed, have witnessed or are aware of behavior that may be considered hazing, you
must report the incident(s) to
the[ Director of Student and Academic Affairs](mailto:michelle.blackburn@makeschool.com) or use
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form). In the event the hazing activity
has put a student’s safety at risk or is an emergency, you should contact 911 to get emergency
medical attention.

Incidents of hazing are not eligible for an Informal Resolution of the
[Student Conduct Process](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr). TK_FIX link student conduct process

#### Hazardous Materials

Make School may use chemicals and substances that require special handling, storage, deployment, and
disposal in our maintenance and cleaning functions. Federal regulations and our local OSHA
authorities require that the campus implement a Hazard Communication Program to alert our campus to
the presence of these substances and any potential risk of exposure. Should you see any procedures
that appear questionable, products in use whose properties you question, or the mishandling of a
chemical, please immediately bring the matter to the attention of the Operations Team. The sale,
manufacture, or unauthorized possession/maintenance of hazardous or toxic substances on Make School
property is prohibited.

#### Medical Amnesty

Student health and safety are of primary concern at Make School. As such, in situations where there
is a medical emergency as a result of violation of policy (e.g., alcohol or drug use), Make School
encourages individuals to seek medical assistance for themselves or others. If an individual seeks
medical attention, Make School may not pursue student conduct sanctions against the student for
violations of these policies or the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_. Additionally, those
students who assist in obtaining medical attention for others may not receive sanctions for
violations of student policy or the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_. This policy does not
grant amnesty to those who are charged with possession and intent to distribute drugs.

This policy does not preclude sanctions due to any other violations of the _Code of Conduct, Equity
& Inclusion_ or student policy. Likewise, it does not prevent action by police or other law
enforcement personnel.

#### Off-Campus Conduct

All students are expected to follow local, state and federal laws at all times. Make School may
determine, on a case-by-case basis, to address off-campus violations of local, state, and federal
through the student conduct process if the violation poses a health or safety risk to the Make
School community or is detrimental to the educational interest of others. Any student conduct
process will be independent from criminal proceedings and will not be impacted by the outcomes of
the legal process.

In the event off-campus conduct results in an arrest or criminal proceedings, students are
responsible for obtaining bail funding and legal counsel independently.

#### Non-Retaliation

No individual shall be penalized in any way for having reported or threatened to report any
violation of procedure, policy, or non-compliance with the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_, or
for cooperating with or participating in any grievance investigation. Furthermore, no individual
shall be penalized for reporting incidents of discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct.
Retaliation by any member of the community against such an individual is prohibited, and shall be
considered a serious violation of Make School policy. Retaliation includes threats, intimidation,
reprisals, and any adverse actions related to an individual’s employment or Education.

### Title IX: Understanding Harassment & Sexual Misconduct

[Title IX](https://www.dominican.edu/about/safety-and-emergency-information/sexual-misconduct-title-ix-and-discrimination)
protects students enrolled in educational programs or activities from gender discrimination,
harassment, and sexual misconduct. More specifically, it protects against any conduct that has the
intent or effect of unreasonably interfering with one’s performance at Make School, or that creates
an intimidating, hostile, and pervasive environment. Examples of misconduct include (but are not
limited to) offensive verbal comments, inappropriate physical contact, deliberate intimidation,
sexual images in public spaces, and exclusionary or offensive jokes. Harassment does not need to be
recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed. **All students,
both online and on-campus, are protected by Title IX and are entitled to all support services and
supportive measures for students impacted by sexual misconduct.**

All Make School designated Title IX investigators have received
[training](https://icslawyer.com/posting-for-review-higher-ed-investigator-level-1-two-day/) as
required by OCR in §106.45(b)(10)(i)(D).

#### Reporting Misconduct

Make School refuses to accept any violation of the _Code of Conduct, Equity & Inclusion_, including
violations of our standard Conduct Policies and
[Title IX Policy](https://www.dominican.edu/sites/default/files/2020-11/title_ix_policy_dhr_policy_for_employees-after-aug14.pdf).
Those asked to stop inappropriate behaviors are expected to comply immediately and may face further
disciplinary action (i.e., being removed from community spaces, etc.). To keep our community safe,
we encourage reporting conduct violations, and will maintain reporter privacy to the extent
permissible by law and policy. Conduct violations can be reported via our
[Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form) or emailed directly to our
[Title IX Coordinator](mailto:student.affairs@makeschool.com).

- **Title IX Coordinator:** Carmen Ye ([carmen@makeschool.com](mailto:carmen@makeschool.com))
- **Lead Investigator:** Michelle Lessly Backburn
  ([michelle.blackburn@makeschool.com](mailto:michelle.blackburn@makeschool.com))
- **Decision Making Administrator (DMA):** Anne Spalding
  ([anne@makeschool.com](mailto:anne@makeschool.com))

#### Reporting Options and Resources

For all Title IX disclosures and incident reports, medical and counseling support or resources will
be offered, and interim remedies may be made available (e.g., room or class schedule change for
respondent or no contact order) to both the Complainant (person who was subject to the alleged
violation) and the Respondent (person alleged of the violation). Based upon the nature of the
incident, Make School students may be subject to the Title IX processes as described below. A report
of this nature will be reflected in Make School’s annual crime statistics if it meets reporting
criteria.

\*In certain instances, the University may need to report conduct to law enforcement authorities
even when the complainant has not decided to do so. The processes listed above may occur
simultaneously, although the Make School’s disciplinary processes and the Criminal process occur
independently of each other.

#### Responding to Misconduct

In the event Make School has actual knowledge of a potential violation of the Conduct Policies and
Title IX Policy, Make School will most likely take the actions (not necessarily in this order):

- Identify policies implicated by the alleged misconduct.
- Assess any potential health/safety concerns of parties involved and initiate or assist with any
  necessary interim actions or remedial measures for both the Complainant and the Respondent.
- Provide an advisor, if needed by either party.
- Conduct an immediate inquiry to determine if there is reasonable cause the responding party may
  have violated this policy.
- Prepare the initial Notice of Investigation (NOI) on the basis of the preliminary inquiry.
- Commence a thorough, reliable, and impartial investigation and interview all relevant individuals
  and conduct follow-up interviews as necessary in a promptly manner.
- Provide regular status updates to the parties throughout the investigation.
- Write an executive report summarizing the investigation, supporting evidence, and list of
  witnesses whose information will be used to render a finding. Parties will have 10 days to review
  the executive report when it is completed.
- Submit the Executive Report to the Decision-Making Administrators for review.
- Conduct a live hearing with the opportunity for cross-examination.
- The Decision-Making Administrators determine if the evidence supports a finding of a policy
  violation and, if so, issue appropriate sanctions, with undue delay to each party. _In cases
  involving students where the potential outcomes may be severe or significant (e.g., suspension or
  expulsion), the Decision-Making Administrators will employ a hearing panel format to render
  findings and decisions._
- Review and determine appeal requests, when applicable.

## On-Campus Policies

### On-Campus Policies Overview

The policies included in this section of the Catalog are specifically campus-related. Students
should be aware of and abide by these policies at all times.

### Campus Access Policy

Make School is open during typical business operating hours (Monday through Friday, 9:00am to
6:00pm). Students have access to campus from 8:00am-8:30pm Monday through Friday and 9:00am-8:00pm
Saturday and Sunday. There may be occasional evening and weekend events hosted by Make School or
other companies on campus. All events will have assigned student “Openers” and “Closers,” who are
trained on alarm codes and building safety precautions. Events will also have an identified Make
School staff member to be “on call” in case of emergency.

#### Guest Access

Make School is open to current and prospective students, as well as guests. Guests and visitors are
welcome to visit the campus during normal business operating hours (Monday through Friday, 8:00am to
8:30pm), but must check in upon entry. Guests are also welcome to attend any Make School event that
is open to the public. Please note that students are responsible for the actions and behaviors of
their on-campus guests at all times.

#### Conference Rooms

The campus conference rooms are prioritized for use by Make School staff. Students are encouraged to
work in the open space work environment to learn from one another and better collaborate. If a
student needs to use a conference room, they will need to reserve the room through a Make School
staff member.

#### Shared Work Spaces

Make School is a shared open space work environment, which means it is especially important to
respect everyone’s physical space and be cognizant of your surroundings. Respectful action includes
being quiet in designated quiet areas to allow fellow students to focus, and sharing Make
School-owned equipment when necessary. Moreover, It is everyone’s responsibility to keep the space
clean and uncluttered.

#### Kitchen

The kitchen is a shared space for all students and staff. All members must clean up after themselves
immediately when using the kitchen, which includes: putting dishes in the dishwasher, picking up all
trash, wiping up any surfaces used, and cleaning up any trash or debris on the floor. If students
store food in the kitchen, they must abide by the Food Storage Policy posted on the refrigerator.
Per this policy, all students must:

1. Label all stored food with their name and initial date of storage.
2. Remove any of the week’s food items from the refrigerator by 5:00pm on Friday.
3. Be respectful of others by consuming only your food items or community-specified items.

### Emergency Procedures & Preparedness

#### Safety & Security on Campus

Security and safety on campus must be a top priority for all of us. While the Make School is
committed to making our campus a safe environment, it would be impossible to prevent all criminal
activity. To make the campus as secure as possible, the following information is provided so that
you are familiar with procedures Make School has set in place to foster a safe campus environment:

- **Campus Access:** Make School campus is open Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 6:00pm, and
  access to our facilities is monitored and controlled by Make School ID badges.
- **Campus Security:** After Hours Security for Make School and Hotel Zeppelin can be reached by
  phone at (415) 563-0303.
- **Formal Complaints:** A victim of a crime wishing to file a formal complaint against a
  perpetrator who is a member of the campus community should refer to Make School’s
  [Formal Resolution](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr) Policy. Students may also choose to file a Police
  Report. For information about harassment or sexual violence, please refer to the
  [Title IX Policy.](#heading=h.kvh5jwtvzk3w) TK_FIX links formal resolution and title ix
- **Media Inquiries** Any inquiries from the news media regarding the occurrence of criminal
  incidents on campus should be directed to [the Dean](mailto:dean@makeschool.com).
- **Missing Persons Reporting:** In compliance with the Higher Education Act, Make School gives all
  students the option to provide confidential contact information for a person to be notified in the
  event a student is officially reported as missing. Should you have concerns about an individual
  who may be missing, please speak to the
  [Director of Student and Academic Affairs](mailto:michelle.blackburn@makeschool.com).
- **Notification of Current Campus Crime:** Title II of Federal Public Law 101-542, The Jeanne Clery
  Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, requires colleges to collect
  and report statistics concerning the occurrence on campus of certain criminal offenses which must
  be reported to campus security authorities or local police agencies. Those criminal offenses
  include murder, rape, sex offenses, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and motor vehicle
  theft. In addition, the Violence Against Women Re-authorization Act (VAWRA) requires colleges to
  report incidents of dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking in addition to crimes related
  to sexual misconduct and sexual assault. At Make School, the Office of Compliance collects data
  about these crimes, which are published each year. Information is also collected about arrests for
  liquor law violations, for drug abuse violations, and for weapon possession.
- **Reporting Crimes & Emergencies:** In the event of a violent crime, a crime in progress, or an
  incident involving personal injury or requiring medical attention, immediately contact the San
  Francisco Police Department or San Francisco Fire Department by dialing 911.
- **Reporting Non-Emergency Criminal Acts:** Non-emergency criminal acts (e.g., vandalism, burglary,
  etc.) should immediately be reported to:

  [Michelle Lessly Blackburn](mailto:michelle.blackburn@makeschool.com)

  Director of Student Academic Affairs and Clery Officer

#### Emergency Notification System

All students are enrolled into Make School’s emergency alert notification system. In the event of an
emergency situation on campus, the system sends text and voice messages to the campus community with
important information and instructions. It is imperative that students follow the directions and
instructions provided by the system. Make School staff or local civil agencies will initiate
procedures to inform students of the nature of the situation and steps to follow.

#### Procedures & Preparedness

Please follow the protocols listed below for each emergency situation.

##### Earthquake

**When indoors:** drop to the floor and take cover. Be prepared to move with it until the shaking
stops. If not near a desk or table, huddle against the interior wall of the room and protect your
head and neck with your arms. Avoid exterior walls, windows, hanging objects, mirrors, tall
furniture, large appliances, and cabinets with heavy objects or glass. Do not go outside until you
know that there is safe passage, and no falling debris outside of the building.

**If you are in bed**, hold on and stay there. Protect your head with a pillow. You are less likely
to be injured staying where you are.

**When outdoors:** move to a clear area, if you can safely do so. Avoid power lines, trees, signs,
buildings, vehicles, and other hazards.

**If you are driving**, pull over to the side of the road, stop, and set the parking brake. Avoid
overpasses, bridges, power lines, signs, and other hazards. Stay inside the vehicle until the
shaking is over. If a power line falls on the car, stay inside until a trained person removes the
wire.

```
It is recommended that everyone in the Bay Area have an earthquake kit ready in case of emergency. Many options are available for purchase through Amazon.
```

##### Fire

Leave the building via the nearest stairway or exit, as safely and quickly as possible if:

- The fire alarm sounds.
- You smell gas.
- You smell or see smoke.
- You are instructed to evacuate.

Some important DOs and DON’Ts to remember, in case of fire:

- DO assist those with disabilities, or those in need, to exit the building.
- DO gather at the evacuation assembly area.
- DO NOT use any elevators to exit the building.
- DO NOT return to the building until instructed that it is safe to do so.

### Poster/Posting Policy

All posted materials must be approved by the Student Experience Team before being hung around
campus. All posters, notices, or flyers must be affixed to the wall or other fixtures via painter’s
tape (blue or green) so as to not damage property. No materials may be posted on doors or windows,
whether inside or outside of the building, and students are responsible for removing their outdated
posters posting sites. Make School reserves the right to remove any posters deemed to be offensive
in nature, or those advertising events and/or products not in line with the _Code of Conduct, Equity
& Inclusion_.

### Service Animal & Emotional Support Animal Policies

Please note that dogs are the only approved Service or Emotional Support Animal (ESA) species
permitted on the Make School campus. While dog breed and size are not inhibited in any way, all
other policies detailed below still apply. For protocol related to Service Animals / ESAs in
residences, please check with your housing provider for their specific regulations. ESAs are not
permitted in Housing for Make School Students at 851 California Street, per the property owner.

#### Service Animal Policy

The ADA defines a Service Animal as any dog (or in some cases other animals) that is individually
trained to work specifically for a person with a physical, sensory, psychiatric, or other
disability.

In compliance with applicable law, Service Animals are generally allowed in buildings, classrooms,
meetings, dining areas, activities and events when the animal is accompanied by an individual with a
disability who indicates the Service Animal is trained to and does provide a specific service to
them that is directly related to their disability.

Service Animals may not be permitted when the animal poses a substantial and direct threat to health
or safety or when the presence of the animal constitutes a fundamental alteration to the nature of
the program or service.

In situations where it is not obvious that the animal is a Service Animal, staff may ask only two
specific questions: (1) is the animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task
has the animal been trained to perform? Staff are not allowed to request any documentation for the
Service Animal, require that the Service Animal demonstrate its task, or inquire about the nature of
the person's disability.

#### Emotional Support Animal (ESA) Policy

Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) are animals that provide emotional support which alleviates one or
more identified symptoms or effects of an individual’s existing disability. Animals whose sole
function is to provide comfort or emotional support are Emotional Support Animals, not Service
Animals.

A student seeking to bring an ESA onto the Make School campus, must make a formal request to
Operations personnel. The request should be made at least 30 days before the start of the semester
or academic year for which the presence of an ESA is requested. Documentation indicating the need
for an ESA must be current, presented on professional letterhead, and signed by the licensed
provider. This documentation must also specifically prescribe an ESA and note the type of animal
that is recommended.

In addition, before a specific ESA is approved, the Handler must submit documentation from a
licensed veterinarian that the ESA is in good health and that its required immunizations are up-
to-date. As part of the approval process, the individual requesting the ESA may be required to meet
with Make School representatives. Make School will provide written notification of animal-specific
approval of an ESA request. If an individual intends to replace an approved ESA with a new animal, a
new request must be made.

Need to register a Service Animal or Emotional Support Animal with Make School? Complete the
[Service Animal Agreement](http://make.sc/service-animal-agreement) or
[Emotional Support Animal Agreement](http://make.sc/esa-agreement) Forms.

### Student Employment

We have a number of paid, student worker opportunities available throughout the academic year for
both on-campus and online students. In order to enable as many students as possible the opportunity
for employment at Make School, students are only permitted to hold one paid position at a time.

To qualify for a paid student worker position, you must meet the following criteria:

- Be in good academic standing (not on an active academic PIP when starting the position)
  - If you are put on a PIP while employed as a student worker, you will be given 1 term to improve.
    You, your coach, and your supervisor will need to work together to create a success plan.
  - If criteria are not met by the end of the term, then you will be no longer eligible for a paid
    student worker position.
- Be in good conduct standing (not on an active behavioral PIP)
  - If you do need an behavioral PIP during your employment, your ability to continue in your role
    may be included in the PIP’s sanctions or outcomes.
- Not be currently employed by Make School or willing to end one paid position to transfer to a new
  role.
- Authorized to work in the U.S. and present documentation confirming employment eligibility status
  to complete an I-9.

Student job opportunities will be posted online as positions become available. All student jobs
descriptions must follow these expectations:

- Work not to exceed more than 10 hours per week;
- Pay may exceed but cannot be less than the minimum wage set by the City of San Francisco,
  regardless of where the student resides;
- The role must be related to the academic program or operations of the School;
- The role must have a predetermined length of employment that may be extended if the work is needed
  and the student has met expectations during their most recent performance evaluation period;
- Student employees must be evaluated on their performance on a semesterly basis to determine if
  they should continue in the role.

### Student Identification Card Policy

All on-campus Make School students are expected to obtain a Student ID Card, which includes a
photograph and student identification number, from the Student Experience Team. Because this ID Card
doubles as the key that provides access to campus, it is especially important that students carry
their card with them at all times!

If a student happens to lose their ID card, they must contact the
[Operations Team](mailto:eric@makeschool.com) to secure a new one. When the new card is issued, the
previous card will be deactivated and the student requesting the card will be charged a $10
replacement fee.

If a student leaves Make School in good academic and behavioral standing, they can continue using
this ID card to access the building and community. If a student leaves and is not in good standing,
their card is deactivated and they are not invited to continue engaging with the Make School
community.

### Weapons

The possession, use, or sale of items such as fireworks, firearms, explosive devices, metal-tipped
darts, knives, or other potentially dangerous items are not permitted on Make School property.
Persons in violation of this policy are subject to disciplinary and/or legal action.

## Academic and Educational Program Information

### Accreditation

Make School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges Senior College and
University Commission (WSCUC) via its
[incubation policy](https://www.wscuc.org/content/incubation-policy) relationship with Dominican
University of California. In Spring 2021, Make School began pursuing independent accreditation from
WSCUC. Until Make School is granted independent accreditation, Make School will remain in the WSCUC
approved incubation policy relationship with Domincian University of California and therefore will
continue to be accredited by WSCUC. Upon receiving accreditation, Make School will end its
incubation policy relationship Dominican University of California and will operate as an independent
educational agency.

### Academic Regulations

All of Make School’s Academic Regulations are located in our Course Catalog & Student Handbook
published on [makeschool.com](makeschool.com). Our Catalog is made publically accessible through our
website and does not require credentials to access its content.

### Academic Freedom

Make School is committed to the open analysis, discussion, and assessment of ideas and values. It
supports the proposition that education involves both analysis and re-evaluation of accepted ideas,
attitudes, and practices of the culture, with the aim of exploring new ways of thinking and acting
and opening new vistas of knowledge. Make School assumes that it is the responsibility of all
faculty to uphold the purposes and aims of the school.

Make School follows the Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom Issued by the
American Association of University Professors. All faculty members and students are afforded due
process. Members of the Make School community have the right to petition a grievance and request an
appeal of dismissal or disciplinary action.

### Academic Policies

#### Academic Calendar

Term start and end dates, as well as key dates and campus closures within each term, are in the
Academic Calendar: [make.sc/academic-calendar](http://make.sc/academic-calendar). Below is a sample
of a standard semester schedule:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="3" >FALL SEMESTER
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>TERM 1: 7 Weeks
   </td>

</table>

#### Academic Honesty & Integrity Policy

Students are expected to practice academic integrity in all of its forms, including abstaining from
plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic misconduct. Make School reserves the right to
determine in any given instance what action constitutes a violation of academic honesty and
integrity.

Plagiarism, defined as the practice of presenting another's work or ideas as one’s own, is an act of
academic dishonesty and is a serious ethical and scholarly violation. Copying text or ideas, whether
verbatim or by paraphrasing from a source without using proper citation, is not accepted at Make
School. Any materials incorporated into your work, regardless of format, must be properly
acknowledged using a citation style appropriate for the discipline of the course.

Though plagiarism may be the most common form, other violations of scholarly integrity also
constitute cheating, including:

- Using or copying information from another student’s code or written work;
- Copying information from another student’s test or using unauthorized materials during an
  examination, whether an in-class or take-home exam;
- Buying, selling, or stealing test questions, answers, or term papers;
- Doing work or taking tests on behalf of another student or submitting work done by another person;
- Falsifying data or laboratory results; and
- Submitting the same work for more than one course without explicit instructor approval.

If an incident of plagiarism or cheating occurs, the instructor will investigate the incident and
consult with the Dean. If the student has been found to have committed an act of academic
dishonesty, an [Academic Misconduct Report](make.sc/academic-misconduct-report) will be filed and
the student will be placed on a [Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr). A
student who believes they have been wrongly accused of plagiarism or cheating, or that the
instructor’s resolution of the alleged incident is unjust, may file a
[Request for Appeal of Disciplinary Action](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr). TK_FIX links pip and request
for appeal

#### Attendance & Participation Policy

Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success.
Attendance means being available (either online or on-campus) from 9:30am to 5:30pm PST each
weekday, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, coaching and school meetings, and
working on homework and group projects when not in a scheduled session. Being available for the
entire school day allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors
and others, and is vital to your learning.

Unless otherwise noted, attendance requirements for classes and other scheduled sessions are:

- No more than two unexcused absences (“no call, no show”) per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than two excused absences (communicated in advance) per term in any scheduled session.

It is the student’s responsibility to know the attendance policy in each course for which they are
registered, and also to notify their instructor and coach by email or slack immediately when they
know an absence is necessary. A student who is ill for more than one week, or who has a family
emergency, should also contact the [Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).

#### Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)

The Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) affords you certain rights with respect
to your education records. Your rights include:

- The right to inspect and review your education records within 45 days of requesting access.
- The right to request the amendment of your records, if you believe them to be inaccurate,
  misleading, or otherwise in violation of your privacy rights under FERPA.
- The right to provide written consent before Make School discloses personally identifiable
  information from your records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without
  consent.
- The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by
  the School to comply with the requirements of FERPA:

        Family Policy Compliance Office

        U.S. Department of Education

        400 Maryland Avenue

        SW Washington, DC 20212-8520

        1-800-872-5327

The School has authority under the Act and **may** release “directory information” concerning
students. “Directory information” may include the student’s name, contact information, date and
place of birth, photo, enrollment status, dates of attendance, concentration of study, class level,
course load, degrees and awards received, date(s) of degree(s), participation in officially
recognized activities, and previous educational institutions attended by the student. This authority
will only be exercised when absolutely necessary.

The above-designated information is subject to release by the School at any time unless the School
has received prior written objection from the student specifying information which they do not agree
to be released. If you would like to make such a request, please contact the
[Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com) for the FERPA Release Form. This should be completed
annually within the first two weeks of the Fall semester.

Further information on FERPA is available at the US Department of Education FERPA website:
[studentprivacy.ed.gov](http://studentprivacy.ed.gov).

### Academic Standing and Satisfactory Achievement

Students’ satisfactory achievement (progress) and standing in the Bachelor of Science in Applied
Computer Science program is measured by course load, course completion rate, and degree completion
progress. Students receive mid-term reports to assess their ability to complete their courses and
remain in good standing.

#### Course Load

In any given term, you should be taking 4 courses (standard load) from the following categories:

- Software Product Development Core (SPD, INT, SWE),
- Technical Courses as determined by your concentration, and
- Science & Letters (S&L)

The 4 (at least 12 credits) course requirements per term:

- Fall & Spring Terms (Terms 1 - 4): 1 SPD Course, 2 Technical Courses, 1-2 S&L Course(s)
- Intensives (INT): Offered in the Fall, Winter, and Spring of the 1st and 2nd year of study.
- Summer Term **with** Internship: Internship (SWE), 1 S&L Course
- Summer Term **without** Internship (alternate to Internship Summer): SPD 1.5, 1 -2 Technical
  Course(s), 1-2 S&L Course(s)

A standard course load is three technical courses (3 credits each) and one S&L course (2 credits per
term, 4 credits per semester). A standard course load is 11 credits which equates to 66 hours per
week.

#### Non-Standard Course Load

If you want to register for a course load of more or less than 4 courses, or otherwise differentiate
from the above requirements in any term, you must meet with your academic advisor and complete the
[Non-Standard Academic Course Load Form](http://make.sc/non-standard-course-load). Submitting this
form means you are aware that not taking the required courses may impact your potential career
opportunities, degree progress, and ISA payback plan. It is not possible to defer any SPD, Intensive
(INT) or Internship (SWE) requirement.

If you choose to take a less than full-time course load or do not follow your degree plan, you may
be required to spend extra time at Make School to ensure that all degree requirements are completed.
Students should be aware that not enrolling in a full-time course load may impact their ability to
be eligible for financial aid.

#### Mid-Term Reporting Policy

Your academic progress is reported by your instructors during every mid-term period. If you fall
behind, they will be notified and given additional support.

#### Degree Completion Progress

In order to stay in good Academic Standing:

- You cannot fail more than 3 courses per academic year.
- If you fail any SPD, INT, or required Technical Course, you must retake _and_ pass that course at
  the next available offering.
- You must have met the following milestones per the bi-annual unit and portfolio guidelines:
  - Year 1, End of Term 2: 17-23 Units completed.
  - Year 1, End of Term 5: 50-60 Units, 2 Portfolio Projects completed, and all foundational courses
    complete.
  - Year 2, End of Term 2: 67-83 Units and 3 Portfolio Projects completed.
  - Year 2, End of Term 5: 106-124 Units, Internship, and 4 Portfolio Projects completed.

#### Failure to Maintain Good Academic Standing or Achievement

If a student does not stay in good Academic Standing or are at risk of failing to maintain good
Academic Standing, they may be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).

#### Academic Dismissal

As a strictly Pass/Fail program, good academic standing is based upon the quality of work shown and
the student's mastery of the course material and determined by the student's advisor/coach, in
consultation with the Dean. If a student is unable to stay in Good Academic Standing and/or fails to
satisfy requirements of the PIP, they may be asked to leave Make School.

#### Appeals

A student may appeal their dismissal and petition for immediate reinstatement. Such an appeal must
be made in writing within the time limit indicated on the dismissal notification letter and must
have the support of the student’s advisor. The appeal letter should be directed to the Appeals
Committee, in care of the Registrar. The Committee has the discretion to:

1. Reinstate the student with an updated PIP, or
2. Deny the petition and allow the dismissal to stand.

### Course Credit Hours

The Carnegie Unit defines a semester unit of credit as equal to a minimum of three (3) hours of work
per week for a semester. This means that one (1) unit of credit equates to three (3) hours of
student work per week (1 hour direct instruction plus 2 hours of homework or 3 hours of lab) for 15
weeks. Direct instruction hours are based on a 50 min class per credit hour allowing for breaks and
transition between classes.

Courses offered in a term of fewer than 15 weeks or in a different format (accelerated, weekend,
hybrid, or distance education) require the same contact hours and preparation time as a 15-week
course; or, if a course has reduced contact hours, the total workload will reflect commensurately
increased expectations for hours of preparation.

As such, the Make School credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes
and verified by evidence of student achievement. The amount of work required for a credit is
calculated in one of the following ways:

- One credit hour equates to 12.5 hours of direct instruction (either in-class hours with an
  instructor or supported project hours with an instructor, teaching assistant or industry expert)
  and 30 hours of out of class student work per term. **Note:** 12.5 hours is calculated by using a
  50 minute class period per credit hour (15hrs \* 50 min per hour = 12.5 hrs)
- One credit hour equates to 45 hours of student work per term for other academic activities as
  established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practicum, studio work,
  community-based learning, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

The number of hours per week required for a credit is calculated from the total credits and the term
length. For a typical 3-credit hour course in a 7 week term, the 37.5 total hours of direct
instruction equates to 5.5 hours a week of direct instruction. In addition, homework and other
out-of-class work constitutes 90 hours total or 12.8 hours per week.

#### Periodic Review of Course Credit Hours

Application of the Credit Hour Policy will be reviewed during the Academic Program Review process to
ensure that credit hour assignments are accurate, reliable, and appropriate to degree level.
Supporting evidence includes syllabi, learning outcomes, assignment schedules, and course schedules
identifying the times that courses meet (if applicable).

New courses, or changes in the unit value of existing courses, should be reviewed and approved by
the faculty curriculum committee for compliance with the credit hour policy.

### Grading System

Make School uses a Pass-Fail grading system which emphasizes the importance of mastery and retention
of course material. Rubrics and other assessment tools are used to gain a clear understanding of
students’ strengths and challenges, and provide an accurate representation of students’ performance
level and knowledge.

While a grade of Pass in a class equates to a C or better on a standard grading scale, Make School
does not compute or report a Grade Point Average (GPA). If students need academic performance
information (i.e. GPA) for the purpose and internship or graduate school application, a
[narrative of their progress](#heading=h.ohmqqjbk2fre) through the program is available upon
request. TK_FIX link narrative of progress

#### Repeated Courses

You may repeat courses in which you earned a failing grade (F). While there is no limit to the
number of times you may repeat a degree requirement, you may only repeat a technical elective course
up to two (2) times. All grades from repeated courses remain on your academic record.

## Enrollment Information

### Enrollment Status

Students are required to be registered for 12 or more units to be considered enrolled \_full-time
\_in the Fall, Spring, or Summer semesters. For the purposes of Financial Aid (including loan
deferments) and enrollment reporting, Make School defines enrollment status as:

- Full Time: 12 or more units
- Three-Quarter Time: 9 - 11.9 units
- Half Time: 6 - 8.9 units
- Less than Half Time: 0 - 5.9 units

For further information regarding how enrollment status affects you, or to get help regarding
submitting a deferment request, contact the
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).

### Student Status Changes

Here’s how students graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree from Make School, and what they need
to do should life’s challenges require them to take a Leave of Absence or Withdraw from the program.

#### Emergency Leave

Make School understands that life does not stop because you are in school. There may be times when
you cannot attend classes for a while due to a family emergency, natural disaster, medical
emergency, or another unforeseeable cause. We define an emergency as:

- An unforeseen family situation (family member death, illness, etc.);
- Natural disaster;
- Injury requiring recooperation;
- An incident beyond the student’s control nessessitatating time away from school.

If you need to temporarily stop attending classes due to an emergency beyond your control, you can
request to take an Emergency Leave of Absence for up to two (2) weeks. To request an Emergency
Leave, you should contact the [Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com) as soon as
possible, but no later than one business day after you are unable to attend classes.

If your leave will need to be extended beyond two (2) weeks, you will need to request a Leave of
Absence.

You may take up to one Emergency Leave per semester. Requests to take more than one Emergency Leave
per semester will require approval from the Dean.

#### Leave of Absence (LoA)

_Students must first meet with their academic advisor or coach before taking a Leave of Absence or
Withdrawing from the Program, as they may be able to address any blockers that are having an impact
on your life at Make School._

You may need to take a temporary Leave of Absence (LoA) from Make School for personal or
professional reasons. To take a LoA, you must submit a Leave of Absence Request form by the term
withdrawal deadline as indicated in the [Academic Calendar](http://make.sc/academic-calendar).
Requests after that must be submitted to the Dean for further review. You can take a maximum of two
terms of leave during your enrollment at Make School.

Important things to consider when going on an LoA:

- Taking a Leave of Absence may have an impact on your financial aid eligibility. Students planning
  to go on leave are encouraged to make an appointment with a Financial Aid Office prior to
  initiating the process.
  - If/when a student takes a leave of absence after the semester/term begins, we may be required to
    return a student’s federal financial aid back to the U.S. Department of Education as per Return
    to Title IV (R2T4) regulations within 30 days of the student taking a Leave of Absence.
- Make School housing is still available to you during your leave. You must maintain your lease and
  continue paying rent during this period. If you opt out of Make School housing, you must terminate
  their lease according to their Housing Agreement
- You can take a maximum of two, term-long Leaves of Absence, consecutively or non-consecutively.
  Extending a consecutive LoA through a second term requires an additional written request.
- If you withdraw after the add/drop deadline of a term, all courses in which you are registered
  will be assigned a “W” grade.

To return from a LoA, students must submit a request to the
[Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com) for the Re-enrollment form. Upon returning, students
will rejoin Make School with the same academic standing as when they requested the LoA, and will be
subject to the same requirements and guidelines.

If a student does not intend to return to Make School, they must officially Withdraw. If they do not
return or extend their LoA, and do not communicate intentions to do so, they will be
administratively withdrawn.

#### Withdrawal from Make School

Withdrawal is when you plan to leave and do not intend to return to Make School. Students will meet
with their coach and/or the Dean prior to submitting an official request. This request must be sent
via completion of the Application for Withdrawal form.

```
Students who have been academically dismissed from the college are automatically withdrawn and do not need to submit a written withdrawal request.
```

Important things to consider when pursuing withdrawal from Make School:

- Withdrawing from the program may have an impact on your financial aid eligibility. Students
  planning to withdraw are encouraged to make an appointment with a Financial Aid Office prior to
  initiating the process.
  - If/when a student withdraws after the semester/term begins, we may be required to return a
    student’s federal financial aid back to the U.S. Department of Education as per Return to Title
    IV (R2T4) regulations within 30 days of the student taking a withdrawal.
- If you live in Make School Housing, you must vacate your room and terminate your lease according
  to the Housing Agreement.
- If you withdraw after the add/drop deadline of a term, all courses in which you are registered
  will be assigned a “W” grade.

In order to re-enroll after withdrawing, you must contact the
[Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com) for the Make School application for Re-Enrollment or
Reinstatement form and submit official transcripts for any coursework completed off-campus while
withdrawn and meet with your Advisor. If you return, you will rejoin Make School with the same
academic standing as when you withdrew, and will be subject to the same requirements and guidelines.

_Students who were academically dismissed from the college must apply for reinstatement, via the
standard admission processes, in order to be considered._

### Cancellation and Withdrawal Refund Policies

#### Student’s Right to Cancel

Students have the right to cancel their agreement for a program of instruction, without any penalty
or obligations, through attendance at the first class session or the seventh calendar day after
enrollment, whichever is later. Cancellation of their agreement can occur through the date denoted
on their enrollment agreement form. The written notice of cancellation, when emailed to
[Registrar@makeschool.com](mailto:Registrar@makeschool.com), is effective when deposited in the mail
properly addressed with proper postage.

If the student obtains a loan to pay for this educational program, the students will be responsible
to repay the full amount of the loan plus interest, less the amount of any refund.

#### Withdrawal from Make School and Refund Policy

Students may withdraw from the school at any time after the cancellation period (described above)
and receive a prorated refund if they have completed 80% or less of the scheduled days in the
current payment period in their program through the last day of attendance. If the student has
completed more than 80% of the period of attendance for which the student was charged, the tuition
is considered earned and the student will receive no refund.

For the purpose of determining a refund under this section, a student may be deemed to have
withdrawn from a program of instruction when any of the following occurs:

- The [Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com), receives notice from the student,
  indicating a desire to withdraw from the program of instruction. The notice must include the
  expected last date of attendance.
- The institution terminates the student’s enrollment for failure to maintain satisfactory progress;
  failure to abide by the rules and regulations of the institution; absences in excess of maximum
  set forth by the institution; and/or failure to meet financial obligations to the School.

For the purpose of determining the amount of the refund, the date of the student’s withdrawal shall
be deemed the last date of recorded attendance. The amount owed equals the daily charge for the
program (total institutional charge, minus non-refundable fees, divided by the number of days in the
period of attendance, multiplied by the number of days scheduled to attend prior to withdrawal). No
refund will be issued to a student who has attended more than 80% of the days in the period of
attendance.

If any portion of the tuition was paid from the proceeds of a loan or third party, the refund shall
be sent to the lender, third party or, if appropriate, to the state or federal agency that
guaranteed or reinsured the loan. Any amount of the refund in excess of the unpaid balance of the
loan shall be first used to repay any student financial aid programs from which the student received
benefits, in proportion to the amount of the benefits received, and any remaining amount shall be
paid to the student. If the student has received federal student financial aid funds, the student is
entitled to a refund of monies not paid from federal student financial aid program funds.

## Academic Procedures

### Documentation Requests

#### Transcripts

To request an official transcript, students must visit the
[National Student Clearinghouse](http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/) website. If you encounter
difficulty or have any questions, please contact the Clearinghouse directly by telephone at (703)
742-4200 or by email at
[transcripts@studentclearinghouse.org](mailto:transcripts@studentclearinghouse.org).

#### Verification of Enrollment & Degrees

To request an enrollment verification for loan deferment purposes, contact the
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com) for further information. Please note
processing time for these requests is 5-10 business days.

#### Progress Narratives

To request a progress narrative report, contact the
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com) for further information. Please note
processing time for these requests is 5-10 business days.

#### Grade Change Petition

To request a grade change, you should complete the
[Grade Change Petition](http://make.sc/grade-change-petition). This petition should be used only
when requesting a reevaluation of a given grade, and should not be used to request an Incomplete
grade. For information on the status of a grade change petition, please email the
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).

#### Incomplete Grade Request

An Incomplete grade means the required work for the course is not yet finished due to extraordinary
circumstances (e.g., illness or very serious personal reasons) beyond your control, and only under
the following circumstances:

- when a limited amount, normally less than 25%, of the student’s work is incomplete;
- when the student is otherwise earning a passing grade;
- when attendance has been satisfactory through the term; and
- when required work may reasonably be completed in an agreed-upon time frame of less than one
  additional semester.

To request an Incomplete grade, you must complete the
[Incomplete Grade Request Form](make.sc/incomplete-grade-request-form). This must be completed
before the end of the term or semester in which they would like to request an “I” grade. You will
receive an email regarding approval of the Incomplete Grade Contract within five business days of
its submission.

Approval by your instructor(s), and the Registrar will enter you into an Incomplete Grade Contract.
This contract temporarily places an "I" grade on your transcript, indicating they are expected to
complete all indicated coursework by the last day of the following term. If the coursework is
completed by the deadline, the Instructor will submit a Grade Change Request form to change the "I"
grade to either "P" for "Passing" or "F" for "Failing." Should this coursework not be completed at
that time, this grade will change to "F" or "Failing."

### Registration

Many courses are only offered in one term during the academic year, which requires taking them in a
specific sequence to stay on track to earn a degree. Students should consult with their academic
advisor before registering for courses. All registration requests are submitted through the Course
Registration Portal and must be approved before students will be enrolled in courses.

First time students will register during orientation after taking diagnostic exams. Returning
students generally begin registering two weeks before the start of each term; specific dates will be
announced to the student body via email.

#### Add/Drop Process

You may request to Add course until the Add/Drop deadline (see the
[Academic Calendar](http://make.sc/academic-calendar)) in the Student Dashboard (SIS). Requests to
Add a class requires an instructor signature. Dropping a course does not require an instructor
signature or request. It is your responsibility to ensure this process is completed.

#### Withdrawing from a Course

You may request to withdraw from the course until the Withdrawal deadline (see the
[Academic Calendar](http://make.sc/academic-calendar)) in the Student Dashboard (SIS). Requesting to
withdraw from a class does not require an instructor signature approval. Students are responsible
for knowing the financial implications of a withdrawal (W) grade and the impact on academic progress
towards graduation. Further information can be found in the
[Financial Implications: Leave of Absence & Withdrawal](#heading=h.8gc851bvz58b) of this catalog.

#### Auditing a Course vs. “Sitting-In” on a Class

Students in good standing (who are not on a [Performance Improvement Plan](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr))
may audit a course with instructor approval, provided that the student: has taken the course
previously and would like to revisit the material; or has an
[Incomplete grade](#heading=h.46zoxwdj1mjj) for the course from the previous term, and seeks to gain
further mastery of the material to complete the course. TK_FIX links pip, incomplete grade

Students in good standing, who have not been approved to audit a course, may request to “sit in” on
one class session of a course. After being granted approval, the student must coordinate with the
instructor regarding which particular session(s) they will join.

#### Concurrent Registration

Make School students may concurrently enroll to take Science & Letters or Foreign Language courses
at off-campus accredited institutions and be granted transfer credit for these courses. The maximum
number of transferable units via concurrent registration is 9 units. However, due to unit
requirements, seniors with 36 or less units remaining will only be approved for concurrent
enrollment in off-campus courses for a maximum of 8 units.

Students are required to obtain prior approval for any coursework they seek to take at another
institution, and all other relevant transfer policies apply to concurrent registration. All
authorizations for off-campus registration must be approved by the Make School Registrar Office
prior to the student’s concurrent enrollment. Students must pass the course in order to receive
credit. Make School will reimburse students who pass their class and receive credit. See step 6 for
more information (below).

##### Process

1. Review the [Make School Articulation Agreements](https://make.sc/articulation) to see which
   classes have been pre-approved for credit at local colleges. You should also make sure the course
   is offered during the desired term as not all pre-approved classes will be offered at all times
   during the academic year. You are welcome to find classes on your own and submit for approval,
   but there is no guarantee that classes not on the articulation agreement list will be approved.
2. Complete the
   [Authorization to Take Course(s) Off-Campus Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZ4BlS23tqoio_ZcMtQdtJT-OyEZ-Rhp6mArJmTSprTcAFow/viewform)
   **_prior_** to enrollment in the course. This will help you avoid unnecessary fees and enrollment
   steps, etc.
   1. Complete the form. Incomplete forms will not be accepted for approval.
   2. Submit the form to [registrar@makeschool.com](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).
3. Once approved, register in the course as soon as possible to ensure you are able to get into the
   approved class as courses do fill up quickly. Registering as an auditor or “sitting in” means you
   will not receive a grade or transcript credit for the course. 3. Note: Unless already admitted,
   you will need to apply for admission to the College in order to enroll in the approved course.
   Admissions is free or fees can be waived at most community colleges in the Bay Area. 4. Save your
   documentation of course enrollment.
4. Take and pass the class.
5. Submit proof of passing the class (transcript) to the Registrar at
   [registrar@makeschool.com](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com)

##### Articulation Agreements

#### Credit for Prior Learning

##### Course Challenge

A student may earn up to 12 units by challenging courses offered by Make School provided the student
has not previously taken or audited the course. Not all courses can be challenged. Students should
check with the Registrar’s Office to determine if a particular course can be challenged. A Course
Challenge form including the course title, the date on which the challenge examination (or other
required activity) will be completed, and the signatures of the student, and the Dean of the School
must be filed in the Registrar’s Office by one month before the challenge will occur. A course
challenge must be completed before the students’ final semester. An administrative fee is charged
per unit challenged. Appropriate units will be granted upon successful completion of the challenge
and will be considered a part of the 30-unit residency requirement. Students may not petition or
receive partial course credit for challenged courses. Up to a 12-unit maximum of challenged
coursework may apply toward residency.

Make School will accept course challenge for up to 12-units from any of these courses:

##### Experiential Learning

Students may earn up to 30 units of credit in the major for college-level learning which is
documented through the satisfactory preparation of Experiential Learning Project Portfolios. Such
learning must:

- Have occurred after the student’s completion of secondary school, and three years of relative work
  experience.
- Have occurred at least one year prior to the creation of the portfolio

A student is required to enroll in SUP 2.2 (ACS 4992) Supervised Intensive Project to prepare the
Portfolio. In the Experiential Learning Project Portfolio a student documents the learning
situation, describes and analyzes the learning experience, and builds project(s) that demonstrate
the knowledge and practical skill competencies as required by the awarding academic department(s).

University credit is granted only for college-level learning (minimum ‘C’ level of proficiency)
which links the prior learning experience with the mastery of learning outcomes of the appropriate
academic discipline. Credit for experiential learning cannot be awarded for duplicate courses
completed through other learning sources. Prior to enrolling in SUP 2.2, a student must meet with an
academic advisor to determine the applicability of Portfolio units within the student’s degree plan,
confirm the availability of two faculty evaluators, and discuss the proposed topic areas. No
guarantee regarding the availability of Portfolio evaluators is made. Evaluation is dependent on
departmental resources.

The final portfolio is reviewed by two faculty evaluators and the dean of the department. Up to 30
units of academic credit (usually 1-3 units per portfolio) is awarded by course number, title and
academic department and may be lower or upper division.

Experiential Learning Credit is posted to the student’s transcript as proficiency units after the
student has completed the 30-unit residency requirement.

Eligibility for the Experiential Learning and Assessment program requires that students have a
minimum of three years of relevant work experience since completing high school.

Make School will accept credit via experiential learning for any of the courses in the following
concentrations / area for up to 12 units (up to 9 upper-division):

- Mobile
- Data Science
- Back End Web
- Front End Web

  Requirement must be satisfied within the first year of enrollment and counts towards your degree
  progress.**

#### International Language Competency Requirement

In order to earn a Bachelor’s degree, all Make School students must satisfy the International
Foreign Language Requirement. While most students will meet this requirement based upon their
foriegn language credits earned in High School, other students will need to meet the requirement
through one of the options listed below.**Note:** Transfer students entering with 60 or more units
are considered to have met this requirement. Second bachelor's degree seeking students are also
considered to have met this requirement.

All required documentation should be sent to the Office of the Registrar.

Students can fulfill this requirement by one of the methods listed below. Bilingual students can be
considered to have met the requirement; see below for methods of documenting competency in a
language other than English.

1. **Approved High School Courses:** Two years of high school study of the same international
   language, completed with a ‘C’ (2.0) average. Courses used to fulfill the requirement should
   emphasize speaking and understanding, and include instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading,
   composition, and culture. American Sign Language and classical languages, such as Latin and
   Greek, are acceptable. This can be confirmed by submitting a copy of your high school transcript
   to the Registrar's office.
2. **SAT Subject Examination:** See below for the qualifying subject examinations and their required
   minimum scores. Scores should be sent to the Registrar’s Office.

</table>

4. **College Courses:** A grade of ‘C’ (2.0) or better in any transferable course(s) (excluding
   conversation) is considered to be equivalent to two years of high school language. NOTE: Many
   colleges list the prerequisites for their second course in a language as “Language 1 at this
   college or two-years of high school language;” in this case, Language 1 fulfills both years of
   the International Language Competency requirement. This can be confirmed by submitting a copy of
   your high school transcript to the Registrar's office. For students who want to enroll in a
   college course concurrent with their Make School enrollment must follow the
   [Off-Campus Courses Policies and Procedures](#heading=h.3skhob6xz1kd) to earn credit for this
   requirement. The following off-campus courses have been approved for meeting the foreing language
   requirement:

TK_FIX link off campus courses policies

- Coursera's Chinese for Beginners and More Chinese for Beginners (must take both)

5. **Formal Instruction in a language other than English:** Completion of two years of formal
   instruction in a school where a language other than English was used as a medium of instruction
   beginning in grade 6 or later, documented by an official school transcript or other official
   document. This can be confirmed by submitting a copy of your high school transcript to the
   Registrar's office.

6. **Assessment by another University:** Most language departments at universities will conduct an
   assessment and issue a statement of competency on official letterhead, which serves as
   certification that this requirement has been met. To fulfill the requirement by this method, a
   student should contact a university with a department in the language to be assessed to request
   an appointment to have an assessment conducted.
   [New York University International Language Exams](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/professional-pathways/proficiency-testing.html)
   have been pre approved to meet this requirement. Scores should be sent to the Registrar’s Office.

7. **Certification by High School Principal:**. Certification should be based on the judgment of
   language instructors, advice of professional or cultural organizations with an interest in
   maintaining language proficiency, or other appropriate sources of expertise. Language placement
   examinations or similar assessments may be used for certification by a high school principal.
   This can be confirmed by submitting a copy of your high school transcript or letter from the
   principal to the Registrar's office.

8. **Take and pass the STAMP test:**

### Internship (SWE) Tuition Policy

Students at Make School are expected to participate in one internship (SWE) to qualify for
graduation.

- Students who take SWE during their 1st or 2nd summer at Make School are not charged tuition for
  that summer, but are charged $10,000 for the summer they are not taking SWE.
- If a student does not take a SWE during the 1st or 2nd summer at Make School (decided at the end
  of Year 2, Term 4), a student will need to talk with
  [financial.aid@makeschool.com](mailto:finance@makeschool.com) about Year 3 Financing.

### Degree Completion Beyond the 2 Year Program

If your degree plan extends beyond two years, you can complete up to 12 additional credits without
being charged if you have maintained Satisfactory Academic Progress throughout your time at Make
School. These 12 credits do not include the SWE Internship and there is no charge for a SWE
Internship taken in the post two-year time period. Students needing more than 12 credits after the
two-year time frame may need to pay tuition for these credits and will need to consult with
financial aid individually [financial.aid@makeschool.com](mailto:finance@makeschool.com).

### Financial Implications: Leave of Absence & Withdrawal

Students may need to take a temporary Leave of Absence (LOA) from Make School, or may leave Make
School prior to conferring a degree. If a student opts to take a LOA, any tuition invoicing would be
placed on hold until the student’s return. Students who opt to leave Make School early, however, are
able to receive refunds on tuition payments based on a per term basis the following conditions:

1. If a student withdraws from Make School before 20% of a term is completed, the student will be
   refunded the full amount of any payments made that term.
2. If a student withdraws between 20% and 50% of the term, they will owe the prorated amount of
   tuition for that term.
3. Once a student attends greater than 50% of a term, they will be responsible for the entire
   tuition of the term.
4. Withdrawn students are eligible to stay in housing offered to Make School students for up-to 30
   days after their withdrawal date. Please refer to your Housing lease for information on
   withdrawing from student housing or ending an independent lease, or reach out to
   [ResLife@makeschool.com](mailto:ResLife@makeschool.com).

### Financial Hold Policy

Under Make School’s Financial Hold Policy, students may be restricted from enrollment in their
classes for non-payment of tuition based on the Enrollment Restriction Criteria. Students will be
notified of their delinquent payment status a minimum of 14 days prior to the New Term start date,
which can be found in the Master Academic Calendar.

#### Enrollment Restriction Criteria

- **Non-Payment Amount Less than $1,000:** Student is allowed to register for 1 term and a 2nd term
  with no outstanding balance. _If the student does have an outstanding balance, they will be placed
  on a financial aid hold._
- **Non-Payment Amount Between $1,000 - $5,000:** Student is allowed to register if they agree to a
  payment plan._ If the student misses two payments, they will be placed on a financial aid hold._
- **Non-Payment Amount Greater than $5,000: _Student is not allowed to register and is placed on a
  financial aid hold._**

These invoices will be sent from this email address:
[invoice@hq.bill.com](mailto:invoice@hq.bill.com) with the subject line, “You have an invoice from
Make School". If you have questions that are related to how to pay the invoice or want to discuss a
payment plan, please reach out to [financial.aid@makeschool.com](mailto:finance@makeschool.com).

In cases when a student has a small balance or payment plan, notification from Financial Aid must
indicate the terms of not complying with the terms via email and/or in the **signed** payment plan
agreement with student and/or parent.

Financial Aid holds that persist for 1-2 terms or more will require students to take LOA for the max
allowable to resolve their balances. After that, if the balance is still not satisfied, the student
is administratively withdrawn from the program. Make School may review student accounts at any time
to ensure proper payment activity.

### Contact Information

All tuition and financial aid questions should be sent to
[financial.aid@makeschool.com](mailto:financial.aid@makeschool.com). Students are encouraged to
review the Make School Financial Tuition and Aid
[webpage](https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science-degree/tuition-and-aid).

## Student Financial Aid Policies

### Federal and State Student Financial Aid

Starting in Fall 2021, Make School will be offering a new financial aid model that will (in most
cases) replace previous payment methods used by Make School since 2014. This new plan is designed to
reduce the average cost of a Make School Education while preserving the core protections of previous
tuition agreements - if you don’t have a job after Make School, you should not have to pay until you
are employed.

Under our new model, students will take primary financing from Title IV funding (Pell Grants, Direct
Federal Loans, Parent Plus Loans) and private loans. Make School has created a protection plan that
will cap your loan payments as a percentage of your income to ensure your monthly loan payments
remain affordable. If you are unemployed, this plan will drop your monthly payments to $0.

This strongly incentivizes Make School to see you succeed - if you are underemployed or unemployed
after graduating, Make School will be helping pay your loans every month. This new protection plan
is called Extended Income Based Repayment (EIBR) and is fully described further down on this page.

Tuition gap payment assistance will still be used in rare cases as gap financing, to cover the
remainder of tuition and living expenses that a student is unable to fund through federal and
private loans. Like the protected loans described above, if you don’t have a job you will not have
to pay back your tuition assistance loan until you are employed. Information about the tuition
repayment plan will be provided during your student loan exit counseling.

### Financial Aid Advising

Make School’s financial aid process combines Title IV funding and private loans with an income
protection plan called Extended Income-Based Repayment (EIBR) to help unemployed and underemployed
alumni of Make School keep their student loan payments affordable. Our financial aid advising
provides ample resources for understanding this program as well as navigating the financial aid
process.

Financial Aid advising begins with detailed descriptions of our financial aid policies on our
website. During the enrollment process, students are invited to financial aid webinars and 1:1
advising from our financial aid team to provide full insight into how our financial aid process
works. Once students have submitted their FAFSA, it is reviewed and each student is sent an
estimated Financial Aid Package that lists eligibility for aid or requests additional documents.
Financial aid advisors then meet with each student to go over their aid eligibility, discuss other
financing options as needed, and walk through the remaining steps required in order to complete
their file. Students have ongoing access to 1:1 advising from financial aid counselors throughout
the program.

As students approach graduation, they meet with financial aid to discuss the post graduation loan
repayment process and implementation of EIBR protection.

### Student, Private, or Personal Loans

Private loans are an option for the students who need additional resources to attend college above
and beyond any federal or institutional aid they may have received. All loans carry the obligation
to repay the amount borrowed with interest and we encourage all students and families to borrow
responsibly.

If this is your first time learning about private loans, we strongly encourage you to review Make
School’s Tuition website before navigating to the private loan search options, specifically the
disclosures relating to federal student aid and the SB 1289 Disclosure Statement.

**Primer on Student Loans**

- Most private loans are credit-based and may require a cosigner for the borrower to be approved.
- The interest rate can be variable or fixed. This rate may be higher or lower than the interest
  rate of a Federal Direct Loan.
- The maximum amount that can be borrowed, in most cases, cannot exceed the cost of attendance minus
  other financial aid.
- For students who have borrowed multiple private loans and/or federal loans, there are
  consolidation loans available. If considering consolidating federal loans into a private loan, pay
  attention to interest rates and there could be a loss of grace period and/or loan forgiveness
  options.

**Private Student Loan Search**

Make School offers a comprehensive list to assist students and families the private loan options
available. THis list was compiled based on a thorough review of borrower benefits, customer service,
a request for information (RFI) process, other students using a lender or product, and/or other
factors. You are not required to select any of these lenders or products. Before borrowing a private
loan, we strongly recommend you maximize your Federal Direct Loan eligibility.

### Disclosures Related to Federal Student Aid

The Applied Computer Science Program at Make School is awaiting final approval from the Department
of Education to process Title IV Federal Financial Aid. If you have any questions, please contact
[financial.aid@makeschool.com](mailto:financial.aid@makeschool.com).

We strongly encourage all students to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
prior to borrowing private loans to determine eligibility for Federal, State, and Institutional aid
for the amount for which they may be eligible to receive. By completing the FAFSA, a student may be
able to receive Federal, State, or Institutional Grants, Federal Work-Study, or Federal Loans.

In addition, we strongly encourage students and parents to consider borrowing federal loans prior to
borrowing private loans. The terms and conditions of federal loans (Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct
Unsubsidized Loan, and Direct PLUS Loan) may be more favorable than the terms and conditions of
private loans.

#### Before Applying for a Private Loan (SB 1289 Disclosure Statement)

Students and families considering loans to assist with funding educational expenses need to be aware
of the difference between federal loans and private loans:

- Federal loans are required by law to provide a range of flexible repayment options including, but
  not limited to, income-based and income-contingent repayment plans, as well as loan forgiveness
  benefits that private lenders are not required to provide.
- Federal loans are provided to most students, regardless of income. Other qualification criteria do
  apply.
- Private lenders can offer variable interest rates that can increase or decrease over time,
  depending on market conditions.
- The interest rate on a private loan may depend on the borrower’s and/or cosigner’s credit rating.
- Private loans have a range of interest rates and fees and the borrower should determine the
  interest rate of, and any fees associated with, the private loan included in their financial aid
  award before accepting the loan. Students should contact the lender of the private loan or the
  Office of Financial Aid if there are any questions about a private loan.

Before applying for a private loan, we encourage students and families to research all options and
make sure you understand the interest rate, fees, terms, and conditions of any loan before applying.

**There is a range of interest rates and fees available and we strongly recommend students to apply
with a creditworthy cosigner to potentially obtain a better interest rate and increase the chance of
being approved.**

In addition, you may apply with multiple lenders to find the best loan for you. Student loans are
provided special protections under credit reporting rules (similar to mortgages)--as long as you
conduct your “shopping” within a 30-day period, there should be no impact on your FICO score or loan
terms (Make School does not guarantee this, but that is our understanding).

#### Endorsement Disclaimer

Make School does not endorse any specific lender or any specific product. The lenders and products
[listed](make.sc/preferred-lenders) are not ranked and these lists are meant to serve only as a
guide for students and families looking for additional options to assist with educational expenses.
Make School does not receive any benefits in exchange for placing a lender on the preferred private
loan list.

Make School is always evaluating the lenders, products, and websites it uses to assist students and
families with the private loan search process. A lender will remain on the lender list unless Make
School has a reason to remove it (such as but not limited to, poor customer service, change in
borrower benefits or rates, etc.).

Make School requests updated information from the lenders on the preferred lender list periodically.
The evaluation process for a lender to be added to and remain on the list includes, but is not
limited to a review of the fees associated with the loan, the competitiveness of interest rates, the
customer service provided, the electronic application and processing capabilities, the borrower
benefits that differentiate the loan product from others, historical use by Make School students,
lender reputation, and/or any unique factors that separate the loan product and/or lender from
others.

### Expanded Income-Based Repayment (EIBR)

Direct Federal Loans come with built-in Income-Based Repayment for students, resulting in payments
being capped at 10% of monthly discretionary income. This provides part of the protection for
underemployed and unemployed graduates. The problem we are solving is that all other student loans
(Parent Plus, Private) don’t come with built-in Income-Based repayments options. So while you could
reduce your Direct Federal Loan payments to $0 if you are unemployed, at other colleges you would
still have to pay monthly for the rest of your loans. Not so at Make School.

Make School is creating and funding an Extended Income-Based Repayment (EIBR) protection plan to
cover Parent Plus and [private loans](#heading=h.cvhmh8iudig) to create full protection for
underemployed and unemployed graduates. TK_FIX link private loans

The EIBR protection plan is designed as an extension of the Federal IBR program to apply to all
types of loans not covered by the Federal IBR and preserve the protection and incentive alignment of
previous payment plan options. The EIBR protection plan will cap total student loan payments
(combined federal, parent plus, and private) to the following percentages of monthly gross income.

_Disclaimer: These caps are subject to change by a few percentage points for future cohorts as we
collect data on how the program is working and what challenges surface._

Any debt obligation beyond the cap will be paid out by the EIBR protection plan. The EIBR protection
plan is funded by 10% of tuition revenue collected by Make School, placed into a protected fund with
transparent financials and independent control. Make School itself is a guarantor for the fund and
will top it up if ever necessary.

We expect that around 80% of students will qualify for the cheaper funding options, government and
private loans, to fund their Make School education. For those who don’t, we still plan on offering
tuition gap funding. To receive tuition gap funding, students will be required to apply for these
new funding options first\*.

_\*If you have significant existing debt that would result in unaffordable monthly payments after
Make School, you may be denied for both loans and tuition gap funding. Please contact us immediately
at [admissions@makeschool.com](mailto:admissions@makeschool.com) if you have more than $7,500 in
outstanding debt. This is not a hard cut-off, just an amount that will trigger a conversation about
the best financial options for you._

### Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for Financial Aid

Federal Regulations require Make School to establish, publish and apply the requirements of
Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for Financial Aid eligibility. This policy pertains to
Institutional, Federal and/or State Financial Aid and is separate from the Academic Policies
established by Make School. The policies for Satisfactory Academic Progress at Make School are
aligned with all
[Dominican Satisfactory Academic Progress](https://www.dominican.edu/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid/financial-aid-policies/satisfactory-academic-progress)
policies while also addressing the unique term schedule and grading policies of the Make School
Program.

#### SAP Evaluation

Make School is responsible for measuring and enforcing Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)
requirements to ensure Financial Aid recipients’ progress towards graduation. To be eligible for
Financial Aid, a student must be in good academic standing and making satisfactory progress towards
the completion of a degree within a maximum time-frame. All enrolled students are evaluated after
each semester to ensure that the minimum requirements are being met. Students failing to meet the
minimum requirements will be assigned one of the following statuses:

**Financial Aid Warning:** If a student fails to meet the SAP requirements, the student will be
placed on Financial Aid Warning for the following semester (or the next semester that the student
enrolls). While on Financial Aid Warning, the student may retain their Financial Aid eligibility and
receive a Financial Aid Award. At the end of the Financial Aid Warning semester, the student’s
record will be re-evaluated. If the student is meeting the SAP requirements after the Financial Aid
Warning semester, the student may be taken off of Financial Aid Warning and re-establish Financial
Aid eligibility for the following semester (or the next semester that the student enrolls).
Financial Aid Warning is only allowed once, during the student’s degree tenure at Make School.

**Financial Aid Suspension:** If a student fails to meet the SAP requirements for any semester after
the initial Financial Aid Warning semester, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension
and will not be eligible for Federal, State and/or Institutional Financial Aid. The status of
Financial Aid Suspension will remain in place until the student is again meeting the SAP
requirements or the student has filed a successful SAP Appeal.

#### SAP Guidelines

The academic year at Make School consists of three semesters (fall, spring and summer) that are
subdivided into terms and intensives. Terms last 7 weeks and intensives last either 1 or 2 weeks.
This is shown in the table below.

<table>
  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>

Make School is an accelerated program and full time students enroll in 12 units per term, 24 units
per semester for fall and spring, and 15 units during the summer semester.

If a student changes concentrations or academic programs, all units reflected on the transcript for
that academic level will be included in the qualitative and quantitative measurements.

**Qualitative Standard**

Make School uses a pass / fail grading structure and does not issue a GPA. A passing grade in a
course is computed through a combination of assessment measures including exams, assignments and
learning outcome rubrics. A passing grade is equivalent to an A, B or C in a standard grading model
and students do not pass nor receive credit for courses completed with any grade lower than C.

Students will be evaluated against the following comparable assessment measured against a norm at
each evaluation period.

- For the purposes of Satisfactory Academic Progress, students are expected to pass at least half of
  their courses attempted in each evaluation period which is considered equivalent to a C average in
  a standard GPA model.
  - Grades of W or F do not count as a Pass and are included in the total number of courses
    attempted.
  - Grades of Incomplete are not included in the total number of courses attempted and do not impact
    calculation results.
- Students may repeat a course for which the student has previously earned credit(s) no more than
  one (1) time. The repeated course will be counted in the GPA calculation for the student one time.
  Any course repeated more than once will not be counted for GPA purposes

**Quantitative Standard**

Students are required to maintain a minimum quantitative Completion Rate of 67% in order to remain
eligible for Financial Aid. Completion Rate is calculated by dividing a student’s total earned
credits by the student’s total attempted credits.

- Attempted credit is defined as any credit(s) the student remains enrolled in after the Census
  Date, including credits that a student withdraws from
- Courses of Incomplete, Withdrawn, and Fail do not count as earned credits.
- Only courses with a Pass count as earned credits.
  - EX: A student is enrolled in four courses (12 credits) after Census Date. They Pass three
    courses and Fail one course. The completion rate is 9/12 = 75%. The student has met the
    completion rate criteria.
  - EX: A student is enrolled in four courses (12 credits) after Census Date. They Pass two courses,
    Withdraw from one course and Fail one course. The completion rate is 6/12 = 50%. The student has
    **not** met the completion rate criteria.

**Maximum Time-Frame**

Students are required to complete all degree requirements within 150% of the published program
length. The published program length of the Bachelor’s Degree program is 124 credits, 150% of this
is 186 credits.

- If it has been determined that a student will be unable to complete the program within the maximum
  time-frame, either by falling below the pace standard or it becomes mathematically impossible to
  complete their program within the maximum time-frame, the student is not eligible for Federal
  and/or State Aid
- If there are mitigating circumstances that affect the student’s ability to complete the program
  within the maximum time-frame a student may appeal to allow for additional semesters to complete
  the program

**Repeat Coursework**

If a student has received a passing grade for a course, Federal Aid may be applied to the payment of
that course for one additional semester. Repeated courses beyond the initial retake will be excluded
from the enrollment calculation. Also, repeated courses will be counted as hours attempted but not
earned when calculating the percentage of courses completed. Repeated courses will affect the
qualitative, quantitative, and time-frame measurements even if they are not eligible courses to
establish Financial Aid enrollment status.

- Only courses taken at Make School will be looked at under this policy.
- Courses that are available to take for credit more than one time are considered repeated for the
  purpose of this policy only if they are taken one time more than the number of times they can be
  taken for credit.
  - EX: SUP 2.1 may be taken twice for credit so taking it a third time would qualify as repeated
    coursework.

**Incomplete Coursework**

For purposes of evaluating SAP, grades of Incomplete count as attempted units, but not earned units
for the Quantitative Standard. Therefore an Incomplete grade may qualify the student for Financial
Aid Warning or Financial Aid Suspension until a grade has been posted.

#### SAP Appeal Process

Students who have been placed on Financial Aid Suspension have the right to appeal their status to
the Office of Financial Aid. SAP Appeals must be based on extenuating circumstances that seriously
affected the student’s academic performance.

Examples of Extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to:

- Death in the family
- Disabling illness or injury to the student or immediate family member (that required the student’s
  care)
- Emotional or mental health issue of the student that required professional care
- Other extenuating circumstances that were beyond the student’s control

Appeals will not be accepted for any of the following reasons:

- Lack of knowledge/understanding of the SAP Policy
- Medical appeals for illness/injury/hospitalization that do not coincide with the semester(s) of
  sub-standard progress
- Work/Scheduling conflicts (including voluntary overtime)
- Acclimation issues with regard to being in a university setting
- Student has submitted a previous SAP appeal, regardless of reason, and the student is still not
  meeting SAP requirements
- Student is repeating courses to increase the student’s GPA or the student is taking courses for
  degree requirements outside the student’s current program
- Student is taking pre-requisite(s) for a degree program for which the student is not currently
  enrolled in

The SAP Committee will thoroughly review each appeal. If the SAP Committee needs clarification or
additional information, the committee will contact the student directly. Any requested documentation
is to be submitted as soon as possible. SAP Appeal decisions are final and will be emailed to the
student within 3-5 weeks of submission. Students are encouraged to submit their SAP appeal and
documentation as early as possible to allow on-time disbursement of aid if the appeal is approved.
