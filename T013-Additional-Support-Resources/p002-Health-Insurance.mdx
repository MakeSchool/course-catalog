### Health Insurance

Make School does not provide health insurance but all students are expected to have health
insurance. Students can apply for free healthcare via Covered California. Learn more here:
[Medi-Cal](https://www.coveredca.com/medi-cal/)*. *You can also find and enroll in other health
insurance options supported by [Covered California](https://www.coveredca.com/).

Students without health insurance may incur fees with the IRS for lack of coverage.
