# CS: Computer Science

Students in these courses will build on the foundational computer science and master concepts such
as data structures, algorithm design and analysis, discrete math, probability, recursion, and
object-oriented programming. Understanding these topics is necessary to build scalable software that
can gracefully handle millions of users and data points. Technical interviews and programming
challenges very often assess an applicantâ€™s ability to apply these skills and knowledge to a new
problem. Students will write blog posts about these topics explaining how they work to understand
deeper and bolster your online presence as a knowledgeable and proficient software engineer.

**CS 1.3 - Core Data Structures & Algorithms (ACS 2130) _3 Credits_**

_Prerequisites: CS 1.2_

This course explores the foundations of computer science including abstract data types, data
structures, and algorithm analysis and design. Students will compare and contrast iterative and
recursive algorithms to analyze design and performance tradeoffs. Students will implement and test
data structures including lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, graphs, and trees. Students will then
apply these concepts to real world problems to understand their tradeoffs. Students will also write
technical articles about these topics to deepen understanding, improve technical writing, and
bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers

**CS 2.1 - Advanced Trees and Algorithms (ACS 3110) _3 Credits_**

_Prerequisites: CS 1.3_

In this course students will implement and test advanced data structures and algorithms, analyze
algorithmic complexity, benchmark performance in time and memory usage. Key concepts include
divide-and-conquer recursion, sorting algorithms, heaps, and advanced tree structures. Students will
build an original project that applies these data structures to real-world problems such as
autocomplete, expression parsing, and phylogenetic trees. Students will also write technical
articles about these topics to deepen understanding, improve technical writing, and bolster their
online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.

**CS 2.2 - Advanced Recursion & Graphs (ACS 3120) _3 Credits_**

_Prerequisites: CS 1.3_

This course covers graph theory, data structures, algorithms, and analysis. Key concepts include
recursion, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, memoization, graph traversal, spanning trees, and
network optimization. Students will build an original project whose underlying structure requires
the use of graph structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems. Students will also write
technical articles about these topics to deepen understanding, improve technical writing, and
bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.
