# Foundation

Students in the five foundation courses will master the basics of computer science and full stack
web development. Students will also learn the basic skills and tools of the software development
process. These courses are taken in a studentâ€™s first terms at Make School and are the foundation of
all the technical courses.

**CS 1.0 - Introduction to Programming (ACS 1100) _3 Credits_**

_Prerequisites: None_

This course provides a practical hands-on introduction to the fundamentals of programming, including
data types, variables, conditionals, control flow, loops, lists, file input and output, and
functions. Students will learn to work with industry relevant tooling and develop software
development skills including writing pseudocode, drawing flowchart diagrams, problem solving, and
debugging.

**CS 1.11 - Object Oriented Programming (ACS 1111) _3 Credits_**

_Prerequisites: CS 1.0_

This course introduces students to the principles and techniques in object-oriented analysis,
design, and programming. Such topics include encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and
polymorphism, and best practices for developing object-oriented programs. The course will also cover
how computers work, from components and layout to memory and machine code instructions.

**CS 1.2 - Intro to Data Structures (ACS 1120) _3 Credits_**

_Prerequisites: CS 1.1_

In this course students will explore the foundations of data structures and algorithms to see how
they work. In addition to implementing these structures in an application; students will build them
from scratch, analyze their complexity, and benchmark their performance to gain an understanding of
their tradeoffs and when to use them in practice.
