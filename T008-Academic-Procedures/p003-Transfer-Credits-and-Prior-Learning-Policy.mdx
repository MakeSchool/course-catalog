# Transfer Credits & Prior Learning Policy

Make School permits the transfer, concurrent or prior learning credits for courses in the major
(Technical curriculum), and transfer or concurrent credits in the CORE: Science & Letters courses
at:

- Degree-granting, regionally accredited, post-secondary two- or four-year institutions;
- Post-secondary institutions which are candidates for WASC accreditation; and
- From College Board-approved prior learning standardized examinations; and
- For courses taken at accredited universities outside of the United States.

Total transfer and credit for prior learning in the degree (including CORE: Science & Letters)
courses is 70 units up to 9-upper-division.

## CORE: Science & Letters

Students may transfer credits to meet the Science & Letters requirements only and satisfying up to
36 out of the 124 credit units required for the BACS degree. Students must have earned a passing
grade of “C” or above in their previous coursework for the credit to be successfully transferred to
Make School. Please refer to the full list of
[Transfer Credit Policies](https://dominican.smartcatalogiq.com/2019-2020/Academic-Catalog/Academic-Policies-and-Procedures/Transfer-Credit-Policies)
for Science & Letters requirements for more detail. Transfer credits do not count toward attempted
credits on a student’s transcript, but do count toward credits earned toward the Bachelor of Science
degree. Students are not required to pay a fee or be charged for transferring credits.

Make School students may concurrently enroll to take Science & Letters courses at off-campus
accredited institutions and be granted transfer credit for these courses. The maximum number of
transferable units via concurrent registration is 9 units. Students are required to obtain prior
approval for any coursework they seek to take at another institution, and all other relevant
transfer policies apply to concurrent registration. All authorizations for off-campus registration
must be approved by the Office of the Registrar prior to the student’s concurrent enrollment.

### _CORE areas for which we will accept transfer credit:_

- EC 1000: Effective Communication 1
- EC 2000: Effective Communication 2 _(2nd-degree students only)_

## Technical Curriculum

Students may transfer credits up to 42 credits to meet the program's Technical curriculum in which a
grade of C or better has been earned. Courses that earned a ”Pass” or “Credit” (CR) grade must be
certified as equivalent to a grade of C or higher to be accepted. Make School will grant transfer
units based on:

- Content, level,
- Comparability, and
- Learning outcomes of the courses taken

## Credit for Prior Learning

### Course Challenge

A student may earn up to 12 units by challenging courses offered by Make School provided the student
has not previously taken or audited the course. Not all courses can be challenged. Students should
check with the Registrar’s Office to determine if a particular course can be challenged. A Course
Challenge form including the course title, the date on which the challenge examination (or other
required activity) will be completed, and the signatures of the student, and the Dean of the School
must be filed in the Registrar’s Office by one month before the challenge will occur. A course
challenge must be completed before the students’ final semester. An administrative fee is charged
per unit challenged. Appropriate units will be granted upon successful completion of the challenge
and will be considered a part of the 30-unit residency requirement. Students may not petition or
receive partial course credit for challenged courses. Up to a 12-unit maximum of challenged
coursework may apply toward residency.

Make School will accept course challenge for up to 12-units from any of these courses:

### Experiential Learning

Students may earn up to 30 units of credit in the major for college-level learning which is
documented through the satisfactory preparation of Experiential Learning Project Portfolios. Such
learning must:

- Have occurred after the student’s completion of secondary school, and three years of relative work
  experience.
- Have occurred at least one year prior to the creation of the portfolio

A student is required to enroll in SUP 2.2 (ACS 4992) Supervised Intensive Project to prepare the
Portfolio. In the Experiential Learning Project Portfolio a student documents the learning
situation, describes and analyzes the learning experience, and builds project(s) that demonstrate
the knowledge and practical skill competencies as required by the awarding academic department(s).

University credit is granted only for college-level learning (minimum ‘C’ level of proficiency)
which links the prior learning experience with the mastery of learning outcomes of the appropriate
academic discipline. Credit for experiential learning cannot be awarded for duplicate courses
completed through other learning sources. Prior to enrolling in SUP 2.2, a student must meet with an
academic advisor to determine the applicability of Portfolio units within the student’s degree plan,
confirm the availability of two faculty evaluators, and discuss the proposed topic areas. No
guarantee regarding the availability of Portfolio evaluators is made. Evaluation is dependent on
departmental resources.

The final portfolio is reviewed by two faculty evaluators and the dean of the department. Up to 30
units of academic credit (usually 1-3 units per portfolio) is awarded by course number, title and
academic department and may be lower or upper division.

Experiential Learning Credit is posted to the student’s transcript as proficiency units after the
student has completed the 30-unit residency requirement.

Eligibility for the Experiential Learning and Assessment program requires that students have a
minimum of three years of relevant work experience since completing high school.

Make School will accept credit via experiential learning for any of the courses in the following
concentrations / area for up to 12 units (up to 9 upper-division):

- Mobile
- Data Science
- Back End Web
- Front End Web
- Software Product Development
