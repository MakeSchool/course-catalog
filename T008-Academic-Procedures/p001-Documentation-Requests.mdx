# Documentation Requests

## Transcripts

To request an official transcript, students must visit the
[National Student Clearinghouse](http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/) website. If you encounter
difficulty or have any questions, please contact the Clearinghouse directly by telephone at (703)
742-4200 or by email at
[transcripts@studentclearinghouse.org](mailto:transcripts@studentclearinghouse.org).

## Verification of Enrollment & Degrees

To request an enrollment verification for loan deferment purposes, contact the
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.org) for further information. Please note
processing time for these requests is 5-10 business days.

## Progress Narratives

To request a progress narrative report, contact the
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.org) for further information. Please note
processing time for these requests is 5-10 business days.

## Grade Change Petition

To request a grade change, you should complete the
[Grade Change Petition](http://make.sc/grade-change-petition). This petition should be used only
when requesting a reevaluation of a given grade, and should not be used to request an Incomplete
grade. For information on the status of a grade change petition, please email the
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.org).

## Incomplete Grade Request

An Incomplete grade means the required work for the course is not yet finished due to extraordinary
circumstances (e.g., illness or very serious personal reasons) beyond your control, and only under
the following circumstances:

- when a limited amount, normally less than 25%, of the student’s work is incomplete;
- when the student is otherwise earning a passing grade;
- when attendance has been satisfactory through the term; and
- when required work may reasonably be completed in an agreed-upon time frame of less than one
  additional semester.

To request an Incomplete grade, you must complete the
[Incomplete Grade Request Form](make.sc/incomplete-grade-request-form). This must be completed
before the end of the term or semester in which they would like to request an “I” grade. You will
receive an email regarding approval of the Incomplete Grade Contract within five business days of
its submission.

Approval by your instructor(s), and the Registrar will enter you into an Incomplete Grade Contract.
This contract temporarily places an "I" grade on your transcript, indicating they are expected to
complete all indicated coursework by the last day of the following term. If the coursework is
completed by the deadline, the Instructor will submit a Grade Change Request form to change the "I"
grade to either "P" for "Passing" or "F" for "Failing." Should this coursework not be completed at
that time, this grade will change to "F" or "Failing."
