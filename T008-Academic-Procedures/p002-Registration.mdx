# Registration

Many courses are only offered in one term during the academic year, which requires taking them in a
specific sequence to stay on track to earn a degree. Students should consult with their academic
advisor before registering for courses. All registration requests are submitted through the Course
Registration Portal and must be approved before students will be enrolled in courses.

First time students will register during orientation after taking diagnostic exams. Returning
students generally begin registering two weeks before the start of each term; specific dates will be
announced to the student body via email.

## Add/Drop Process

You may request to Add course until the Add/Drop deadline (see the
[Academic Calendar](http://make.sc/academic-calendar)) in the Student Dashboard (SIS). Requests to
Add a class requires an instructor signature. Dropping a course does not require an instructor
signature or request. It is your responsibility to ensure this process is completed.

## Withdrawing from a Course

You may request to withdraw from the course until the Withdrawal deadline (see the
[Academic Calendar](http://make.sc/academic-calendar)) in the Student Dashboard (SIS). Requesting to
withdraw from a class does not require an instructor signature approval. Students are responsible
for knowing the financial implications of a withdrawal (W) grade and the impact on academic progress
towards graduation. Further information can be found in the
[Financial Implications: Leave of Absence & Withdrawal](#heading=h.8gc851bvz58b) of this catalog.

## Auditing a Course vs. “Sitting-In” on a Class

Students in good standing (who are not on a [Performance Improvement Plan](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr))
may audit a course with instructor approval, provided that the student: has taken the course
previously and would like to revisit the material; or has an
[Incomplete grade](#heading=h.46zoxwdj1mjj) for the course from the previous term, and seeks to gain
further mastery of the material to complete the course. TK_FIX links pip, incomplete grade

Students in good standing, who have not been approved to audit a course, may request to “sit in” on
one class session of a course. After being granted approval, the student must coordinate with the
instructor regarding which particular session(s) they will join.

## Concurrent Registration

Make School students may concurrently enroll to take Science & Letters or Foreign Language courses
at off-campus accredited institutions and be granted transfer credit for these courses. The maximum
number of transferable units via concurrent registration is 9 units. However, due to unit
requirements, seniors with 36 or less units remaining will only be approved for concurrent
enrollment in off-campus courses for a maximum of 8 units.

Students are required to obtain prior approval for any coursework they seek to take at another
institution, and all other relevant transfer policies apply to concurrent registration. All
authorizations for off-campus registration must be approved by the Make School Registrar Office
prior to the student’s concurrent enrollment. Students must pass the course in order to receive
credit. Make School will reimburse students who pass their class and receive credit. See step 6 for
more information (below).

### Process

1. Review the [Make School Articulation Agreements](https://make.sc/articulation) to see which
   classes have been pre-approved for credit at local colleges. You should also make sure the course
   is offered during the desired term as not all pre-approved classes will be offered at all times
   during the academic year. You are welcome to find classes on your own and submit for approval,
   but there is no guarantee that classes not on the articulation agreement list will be approved.
2. Complete the
   [Authorization to Take Course(s) Off-Campus Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZ4BlS23tqoio_ZcMtQdtJT-OyEZ-Rhp6mArJmTSprTcAFow/viewform)
   **_prior_** to enrollment in the course. This will help you avoid unnecessary fees and enrollment
   steps, etc.
   1. Complete the form. Incomplete forms will not be accepted for approval.
   2. Submit the form to [registrar@makeschool.com](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).
3. Once approved, register in the course as soon as possible to ensure you are able to get into the
   approved class as courses do fill up quickly. Registering as an auditor or “sitting in” means you
   will not receive a grade or transcript credit for the course. 3. Note: Unless already admitted,
   you will need to apply for admission to the College in order to enroll in the approved course.
   Admissions is free or fees can be waived at most community colleges in the Bay Area. 4. Save your
   documentation of course enrollment.
4. Take and pass the class.
5. Submit proof of passing the class (transcript) to the Registrar at
   [registrar@makeschool.com](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com)
