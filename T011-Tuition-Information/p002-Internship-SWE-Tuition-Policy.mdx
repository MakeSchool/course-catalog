# Internship (SWE) Tuition Policy

Students at Make School are expected to participate in one internship (SWE) to qualify for
graduation.

- Students who take SWE during their 1st or 2nd summer at Make School are not charged tuition for
  that summer, but are charged $10,000 for the summer they are not taking SWE.
- If a student does not take a SWE during the 1st or 2nd summer at Make School (decided at the end
  of Year 2, Term 4), a student will need to talk with
  [financial.aid@makeschool.org](mailto:finance@makeschool.com) about Year 3 Financing.
