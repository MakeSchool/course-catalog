# Financial Hold Policy

Under Make School’s Financial Hold Policy, students may be restricted from enrollment in their
classes for non-payment of tuition based on the Enrollment Restriction Criteria. Students will be
notified of their delinquent payment status a minimum of 14 days prior to the New Term start date,
which can be found in the Master Academic Calendar.

## Enrollment Restriction Criteria

- **Non-Payment Amount Less than $1,000:** Student is allowed to register for 1 term and a 2nd term
  with no outstanding balance. _If the student does have an outstanding balance, they will be placed
  on a financial aid hold._
- **Non-Payment Amount Between $1,000 - $5,000:** Student is allowed to register if they agree to a
  payment plan._ If the student misses two payments, they will be placed on a financial aid hold._
- **Non-Payment Amount Greater than $5,000: _Student is not allowed to register and is placed on a
  financial aid hold._**

These invoices will be sent from this email address:
[invoice@hq.bill.com](mailto:invoice@hq.bill.com) with the subject line, “You have an invoice from
Make School". If you have questions that are related to how to pay the invoice or want to discuss a
payment plan, please reach out to [financial.aid@makeschool.com](mailto:finance@makeschool.com).

In cases when a student has a small balance or payment plan, notification from Financial Aid must
indicate the terms of not complying with the terms via email and/or in the **signed** payment plan
agreement with student and/or parent.

Financial Aid holds that persist for 1-2 terms or more will require students to take LOA for the max
allowable to resolve their balances. After that, if the balance is still not satisfied, the student
is administratively withdrawn from the program. Make School may review student accounts at any time
to ensure proper payment activity.
