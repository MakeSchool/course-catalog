# Degree Completion Beyond the 2 Year Program

If your degree plan extends beyond two years, you can complete up to 12 additional credits without
being charged if you have maintained Satisfactory Academic Progress throughout your time at Make
School. These 12 credits do not include the SWE Internship and there is no charge for a SWE
Internship taken in the post two-year time period. Students needing more than 12 credits after the
two-year time frame may need to pay tuition for these credits and will need to consult with
financial aid individually [financial.aid@makeschool.org](mailto:finance@makeschool.com).
