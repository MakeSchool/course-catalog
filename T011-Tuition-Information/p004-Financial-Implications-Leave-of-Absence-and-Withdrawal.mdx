# Financial Implications: Leave of Absence & Withdrawal

Students may need to take a temporary Leave of Absence (LOA) from Make School, or may leave Make
School prior to conferring a degree. If a student opts to take a LOA, any tuition invoicing would be
placed on hold until the studentâ€™s return. Students who opt to leave Make School early, however, are
able to receive refunds on tuition payments based on a per term basis the following conditions:

1. If a student withdraws from Make School before 20% of a term is completed, the student will be
   refunded the full amount of any payments made that term.
2. If a student withdraws between 20% and 50% of the term, they will owe the prorated amount of
   tuition for that term.
3. Once a student attends greater than 50% of a term, they will be responsible for the entire
   tuition of the term.
4. Withdrawn students are eligible to stay in housing offered to Make School students for up-to 30
   days after their withdrawal date. Please refer to your Housing lease for information on
   withdrawing from student housing or ending an independent lease, or reach out to
   [ResLife@makeschool.org](mailto:ResLife@makeschool.com).
