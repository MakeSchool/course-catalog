# Etiquette

We expect all students to conduct themselves in a respectful, inclusive manner when communicating
online, over Zoom, and through social media.

When engaging with others over Zoom or other conferencing programs, you should

- Keep your camera on, if possible;
- Mute yourself unless you are speaking;
- Come to class on time, and check in using the attendance short-link/code/QR code;
- Be mindful of your video/screen sharing. Make sure it is something you wouldnâ€™t mind all your
  peers and instructors seeing
