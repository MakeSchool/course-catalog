# Laptops

Every student must have a fully-operating laptop on which to do their work. The minimum laptop
requirements are, as follows:

- An Apple Laptop
- At least 8 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM)
- At least 100 GB of Solid State Drive (SSD) Storage
- A fully-functioning keyboard and screen and a battery that holds a charge
- A fully-functioning webcam and microphone (both online and on-campus students)
- An operating system supported by
  [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-requirements-for-Windows-macOS-and-Linux).

Since purchasing a laptop can be a large financial burden, we can provide advice for how to find an
economical laptop that will serve you well. Some simple tips are:

- **Upgrade:** If you have an older Apple laptop that lacks SSD storage, you can check if your
  laptop is upgradeable with a new SSD storage component and more memory. If so, the most economical
  option is to purchase an SSD storage and RAM, then install them in your laptop.
- **Buy Used:** Many websites, including Craigslist and eBay, offer less expensive used laptop
  options. When buying a computer through a reseller, confirm with the seller that the laptop is
  fully functioning and that the computer is in decent operating condition. It is especially
  important to focus on the battery, charging cables, keyboard, screen, and USB ports.
- **Buy Refurbished:** You can buy a refurbished MacBook Air for approximately $900. If you combine
  this with a financing option, you may only need to pay approx. $75/month for 12 months.
- **Buy with Apple or Retail Financing:** Apple and other retail stores often offer financial
  options to allow you to pay for a computer over 12 months with no interest.

## Temporary Laptop Assistance

We understand how important it is to have a properly functioning laptop in order to be effective at
Make School. Students are responsible for securing a temporary laptop in the event that their
current laptop is inoperable and needs to be repaired. Make School may be able to assist students
with the cost associated with renting a laptop. For more information regarding temporary laptop
assistance, contact [student.affairs@makeschool.org](mailto:student.affairs@makeschool.com).
