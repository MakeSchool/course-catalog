## Poster/Posting Policy

All posted materials must be approved by the Student Experience Team before being hung around
campus. All posters, notices, or flyers must be affixed to the wall or other fixtures via painterâ€™s
tape (blue or green) so as to not damage property. No materials may be posted on doors or windows,
whether inside or outside of the building, and students are responsible for removing their outdated
posters posting sites. Make School reserves the right to remove any posters deemed to be offensive
in nature, or those advertising events and/or products not in line with the _Code of Conduct, Equity
& Inclusion_.
