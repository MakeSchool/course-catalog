- [Unit and Residency Requirements](https://dominican.smartcatalogiq.com/2019-2020/Academic-Catalog/Undergraduate-Education-General-Degree-Admissions-Information/Undergraduate-Education-General-Degree-Information/General-Requirements-for-a-Baccalaureate-Degree):
  Students must complete a minimum of 124 units, 48 of which must be in upper division courses.
  - At least 28 units of your last 36 units must be completed at Make School.
  - At least 39 units total must be completed at Make School.
- Academic Progress Requirement: Students are required to complete all degree requirements within a
  percentage of the minimum credits required to degree completion. The maximum time-frame allowance
  is 150% of the published program length of the student’s currently enrolled program of study.
- International Language Competency Requirement: Students must demonstrate competency in a
  non-English language. This requirement can be satisfied through approved High School courses, SAT
  subject examination, AP or IB examination, college courses, formal instruction, assessment by a
  university, or certification by a High School Principal. **The International Language Competency
  Requirement must be satisfied within the first year of enrollment and counts towards your degree
  progress.**

## International Language Competency Requirement

In order to earn a Bachelor’s degree, all Make School students must satisfy the International
Foreign Language Requirement. While most students will meet this requirement based upon their
foriegn language credits earned in High School, other students will need to meet the requirement
through one of the options listed below.**Note:** Transfer students entering with 60 or more units
are considered to have met this requirement. Second bachelor's degree seeking students are also
considered to have met this requirement.

All required documentation should be sent to the Office of the Registrar.

Students can fulfill this requirement by one of the methods listed below. Bilingual students can be
considered to have met the requirement; see below for methods of documenting competency in a
language other than English.

1. **Approved High School Courses:** Two years of high school study of the same international
   language, completed with a ‘C’ (2.0) average. Courses used to fulfill the requirement should
   emphasize speaking and understanding, and include instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading,
   composition, and culture. American Sign Language and classical languages, such as Latin and
   Greek, are acceptable. This can be confirmed by submitting a copy of your high school transcript
   to the Registrar's office.
2. **SAT Subject Examination:** See below for the qualifying subject examinations and their required
   minimum scores. Scores should be sent to the Registrar’s Office.

   minimum scores. Scores should be sent to the Registrar’s Office.

4. **College Courses:** A grade of ‘C’ (2.0) or better in any transferable course(s) (excluding
   conversation) is considered to be equivalent to two years of high school language. NOTE: Many
   colleges list the prerequisites for their second course in a language as “Language 1 at this
   college or two-years of high school language;” in this case, Language 1 fulfills both years of
   the International Language Competency requirement. This can be confirmed by submitting a copy of
   your high school transcript to the Registrar's office. For students who want to enroll in a
   college course concurrent with their Make School enrollment must follow the
   [Off-Campus Courses Policies and Procedures](/academic-procedures/registration) to earn credit
   for this requirement. The following off-campus courses have been approved for meeting the foreign
   language requirement:

- Coursera's Chinese for Beginners and More Chinese for Beginners (must take both)

5. **Formal Instruction in a language other than English:** Completion of two years of formal
   instruction in a school where a language other than English was used as a medium of instruction
   beginning in grade 6 or later, documented by an official school transcript or other official
   document. This can be confirmed by submitting a copy of your high school transcript to the
   Registrar's office.

6. **Assessment by another University:** Most language departments at universities will conduct an
   assessment and issue a statement of competency on official letterhead, which serves as
   certification that this requirement has been met. To fulfill the requirement by this method, a
   student should contact a university with a department in the language to be assessed to request
   an appointment to have an assessment conducted.
   [New York University International Language Exams](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/professional-pathways/proficiency-testing.html)
   have been pre approved to meet this requirement. Scores should be sent to the Registrar’s Office.

7. **Certification by High School Principal:**. Certification should be based on the judgment of
   language instructors, advice of professional or cultural organizations with an interest in
   maintaining language proficiency, or other appropriate sources of expertise. Language placement
   examinations or similar assessments may be used for certification by a high school principal.
   This can be confirmed by submitting a copy of your high school transcript or letter from the
   principal to the Registrar's office.

8. **Take and pass the STAMP test:**
   [https://avantassessment.com/stamp](https://avantassessment.com/stamp) for any language other
   than English.

9. **Enroll in a 9-week summer Spanish class** offered at Make School

10. **Enroll in an online language course at a community college or institution of higher
    education.** This course must be pre-approved as meeting the Foreign Language Requirement.
