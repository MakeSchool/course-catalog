# Student Groups

We empower and encourage students to initiate leadership and ownership over clubs. Since each cohort
is unique, we let student voices be heard and support their goals rather than determining standard
clubs. In this way, clubs are inspired and self-formed by the community and its members. Previous
cohorts have organized a Drone Club, Hackathon Club, and Women in Tech Club. Make School staff
members with expertise and/or interest in an area can serve as guides and resources to support
student clubs.

## Student Council

Student Council is a Make School-sponsored group that consists of student advocates, nominated and
elected by their peers, who act as the voice of the student body. The council has weekly meetings
with the Student Experience team to ensure students are happy, heard, and aware of the efforts
employed to support their life here at Make School. The members of the Student Council have the role
of listening to student concerns, and communicating these concerns to Make School staff. Student
Council is granted a budget and can plan student events in collaboration with the Student Experience
team.

## Student Event Coordinators

We encourage students to help organize school-related gatherings! Students who express an interest
in this role volunteer to meet bi-weekly with the Student Experience Team to plan and organize
monthly events for the student body and staff. Events include holiday celebrations, multicultural
day meals, talent shows, spring flings, and other school-sponsored functions.

## Diversity and Inclusion Committee

Students are welcome to participate in developing initiatives to support a diverse student
population. The student-led D & I committee works with the Student Experience team to host
educational programs, trainings, and events to help foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for
all community members.
