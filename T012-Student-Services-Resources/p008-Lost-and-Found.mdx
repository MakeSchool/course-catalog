### Lost & Found

If you lost something at Make School, it is best to check the Lost and Found bin located in the
Student Resource Room. If you cannot locate your item(s), or if you want to report adding an item to
the Lost and Found bin, you can message the #lost-and-found Slack channel. The Lost and Found bin
will be cleared annually.
