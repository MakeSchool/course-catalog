# Job Placement Services

Make School employs an Outcomes Lead who assists graduates in developing job search skills such as
resume and cover letter development, interviewing skills, and appropriate interview follow-up
activities. Make School organizes career-preparation events including talks, dinners, career fairs,
and demo days with industry members to broaden studentsâ€™ professional networks and increase their
access to potential employers. During their time at Make School, students have the ability to
participate in on-site visits to local potential employers, and build an online portfolio to be
showcased during recruitment opportunities. Make School also makes personal introductions to
recruiters and companies for well-qualified students seeking internships and full-time employment.

At no time does Make School guarantee employment or salary, or advertise job availability, degree of
skill, or length of time needed to learn a trade or skill in a misleading fashion.
