### Emergency Procedures & Preparedness

#### Safety & Security on Campus

Security and safety on campus must be a top priority for all of us. While the Make School is
committed to making our campus a safe environment, it would be impossible to prevent all criminal
activity. To make the campus as secure as possible, the following information is provided so that
you are familiar with procedures Make School has set in place to foster a safe campus environment:

- **Campus Access:** Make School campus is open Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 6:00pm, and
  access to our facilities is monitored and controlled by Make School ID badges.

- **Campus Security:** After Hours Security for Make School and Hotel Zeppelin can be reached by
  phone at (415) 563-0303.

- **Formal Complaints:** A victim of a crime wishing to file a formal complaint against a
  perpetrator who is a member of the campus community should refer to Make School’s
  [Formal Resolution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hCAe9psHARguZE-nEeFaYVUbjPG6VvNXWwrQJj7tXMU/edit#heading=h.gjo7cfcjxl90)
  Policy. For information about harassment or sexual violence, please refer to the
  [Title IX Policy.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cP3HyewqxDk3RglFfZA8ju7wSDhBHWpeJi5vWlXK9l8/edit#heading=h.kvh5jwtvzk3w)

- **Media Inquiries:** Any inquiries from the news media regarding the occurrence of criminal
  incidents on campus should be directed to [the Dean](mailto:dean@makeschool.com).

- **Missing Persons Reporting:** In compliance with the Higher Education Act, Make School gives all
  students the option to provide confidential contact information for a person to be notified in the
  event a student is officially reported as missing. Should you have concerns about an individual
  who may be missing, please speak to the
  [Director of Student and Academic Affairs](mailto:michelle.blackburn@makeschool.com).

- **Notification of Current Campus Crime:** Title II of Federal Public Law 101-542, The Jeanne Clery
  Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, requires colleges to collect
  and report statistics concerning the occurrence on campus of certain criminal offenses which must
  be reported to campus security authorities or local police agencies. Those criminal offenses
  include murder, rape, sex offenses, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and motor vehicle
  theft. In addition, the Violence Against Women Re-authorization Act (VAWRA) requires colleges to
  report incidents of dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking in addition to crimes related
  to sexual misconduct and sexual assault. At Make School, the Office of Compliance collects data
  about these crimes, which are published each year. Information is also collected about arrests for
  liquor law violations, for drug abuse violations, and for weapon possession.

- **Reporting Crimes & Emergencies:** In the event of a violent crime, a crime in progress, or an
  incident involving personal injury or requiring medical attention, immediately contact the San
  Francisco Police Department or San Francisco Fire Department by dialing 911.

- **Reporting Non-Emergency Criminal Acts:** Non-emergency criminal acts (e.g., vandalism, burglary,
  etc.) should immediately be reported to:

#### Emergency Notification System

All students are enrolled into Make School’s emergency alert notification system. In the event of an
emergency situation on campus, the system sends text and voice messages to the campus community with
important information and instructions. It is imperative that students follow the directions and
instructions provided by the system. Make School staff or local civil agencies will initiate
procedures to inform students of the nature of the situation and steps to follow.

#### Procedures & Preparedness

Please follow the protocols listed below for each emergency situation.

##### Earthquake

**When indoors:** drop to the floor and take cover. Be prepared to move with it until the shaking
stops. If not near a desk or table, huddle against the interior wall of the room and protect your
head and neck with your arms. Avoid exterior walls, windows, hanging objects, mirrors, tall
furniture, large appliances, and cabinets with heavy objects or glass. Do not go outside until you
know that there is safe passage, and no falling debris outside of the building.

**If you are in bed**, hold on and stay there. Protect your head with a pillow. You are less likely
to be injured staying where you are.

**When outdoors:** move to a clear area, if you can safely do so. Avoid power lines, trees, signs,
buildings, vehicles, and other hazards.

**If you are driving**, pull over to the side of the road, stop, and set the parking brake. Avoid
overpasses, bridges, power lines, signs, and other hazards. Stay inside the vehicle until the
shaking is over. If a power line falls on the car, stay inside until a trained person removes the
wire.

It is recommended that everyone in the Bay Area have an earthquake kit ready in case of emergency.
Many options are available for purchase through Amazon.

##### Fire

Leave the building via the nearest stairway or exit, as safely and quickly as possible if:

- The fire alarm sounds.

- You smell gas.

- You smell or see smoke.

- You are instructed to evacuate.

Some important DOs and DON’Ts to remember, in case of fire:

- DO assist those with disabilities, or those in need, to exit the building.

- DO gather at the evacuation assembly area.

- DO NOT use any elevators to exit the building.

- DO NOT return to the building until instructed that it is safe to do so.
