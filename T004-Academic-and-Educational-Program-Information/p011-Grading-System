## Grading System

Make School uses a Pass-Fail grading system which emphasizes the importance of mastery and retention of course material. Rubrics and other assessment tools are used to gain a clear understanding of students’ strengths and challenges, and provide an accurate representation of students’ performance level and knowledge. 

While a grade of Pass in a class equates to a C or better on a standard grading scale, Make School does not compute or report a Grade Point Average (GPA). If students need academic performance information (i.e. GPA) for the purpose and internship or graduate school application, a narrative of their progress through the program is available upon request. 

Repeated Courses

You may repeat courses in which you earned a failing grade (F). While there is no limit to the number of times you may repeat a degree requirement, you may only repeat a technical elective course up to two (2) times. All grades from repeated courses remain on your  academic record.
