## Credit Policies

Make School’s [transfer policy](#heading=h.wu5v3v6dl8q6) is administered and updated by the Office of the Registrar under the direction of the Dean. 

Technical and Software Product Development Credits

Make School does not accept any transfer, concurrent, or prior learning credits for Technical or Software Product Development courses as these courses are only taught onsite with our project based curriculum. 

Science & Letters Credits

These credit requirements can be met through onsite courses and the following methods:

**Transfering Credits:  **Make School will grant Science & Letters transfer credit units completed at:

* degree-granting, regionally accredited, post-secondary two- or four-year institutions;

* post-secondary institutions which are candidates for WASC accreditation; and

* from College Board-approved prior learning standardized examinations; and

* for courses taken at accredited universities outside of the United States.

Please note transfer credits do not count toward ‘attempted’ credits on your transcript, but do count toward credits earned toward the Bachelor of Science degree.

**Concurrent / "Off-Campus" Registration:  **You may take Science & Letters classes at an off-campus accredited institution while attending classes at Make School  and be granted transfer credit for these courses. The maximum number of transferable units via concurrent registration is 9 units. You are required to obtain pre approval for any coursework you want to take at another institution, and all other relevant [transfer policies](#heading=h.wu5v3v6dl8q6) apply to concurrent registration. To obtain prior approval for concurrent registration, please contact the [Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).
