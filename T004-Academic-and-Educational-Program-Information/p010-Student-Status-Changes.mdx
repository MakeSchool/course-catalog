## Student Status Changes

Here’s how students graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree from Make School, and what they need
to do should life’s challenges require them to take a Leave of Absence or Withdraw from the program.

### Leave of Absence (LoA)

_Students must first meet\*\* with their academic advisor or coach before taking a Leave of Absence
or Withdrawing from the Program, as they may be able to address any blockers that are having an
impact on your life at Make School._

You may need to take a temporary Leave of Absence (LoA) from Make School for personal or
professional reasons. To take a LoA, you must submit a Leave of Absence Request form by the term
withdrawal deadline as indicated in the [Academic Calendar](http://make.sc/academic-calendar).
Requests after that must be submitted to the Dean for further review. You can take a maximum of two
terms of leave during your enrollment at Make School.

Important things to consider when going on a LoA:

- Taking a leave of absence may have an impact on your financial aid eligibility. Students planning
  to go on leave are encouraged to make an appointment with a Financial Aid Office prior to
  initiating the process.

  - If/when a student takes a leave of absence after the semester/term begins, we may be required to
    return a student’s federal financial aid back to the U.S. Department of Education as per Return
    to Title IV (R2T4) regulations within 30 days of the student taking a leave of absence.

- Make School housing is still available to you during your leave. You must maintain your lease and
  continue paying rent during this period. If you opt out of Make School housing, you must terminate
  their lease according to their Housing Agreement

- You can take a maximum of two, term-long Leaves of Absence, consecutively or non-consecutively.
  Extending a consecutive LoA through a second term requires an additional written request.

- If you withdraw after the add/drop deadline of a term, all courses in which you are registered
  will be assigned a "W" grade.

To return from a LoA, students must submit a request to the
[Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com)[ ](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com)for the
Re-enrollment form. Upon returning, students will rejoin Make School with the same academic standing
as when they requested the LoA, and will be subject to the same requirements and guidelines.

If a student does not intend to return to the college, they must officially Withdraw. If you do not
return or extend their LoA, and do not communicate intentions to do so, students will be
automatically withdrawn.

### Withdrawal from Make School

Withdrawal is when you plan to leave and do not intend to return to Make School. Students will meet
with their coach and/or the Dean prior to submitting an official request. This request must be sent
via completion of the Application for Withdrawal form.

Students who have been academically dismissed from the college are automatically withdrawn and do
not need to submit a written withdrawal request.

Important things to consider when pursuing withdrawal from Make School:

- Withdrawing from the program may have an impact on your financial aid eligibility. Students
  planning to withdraw are encouraged to make an appointment with a Financial Aid Office prior to
  initiating the process.

  - If/when a student withdraws after the semester/term begins, we may be required to return a
    student’s federal financial aid back to the U.S. Department of Education as per Return to Title
    IV (R2T4) regulations within 30 days of the student taking a withdrawal.

- If you live in Make School Housing, you must vacate your room and terminate your lease according
  to the Housing Agreement.

- If you withdraw after the add/drop deadline of a term, all courses in which you are registered
  will be assigned a "W" grade.

In order to re-enroll after withdrawing, you must submit a written request to the
[Dean](mailto:anne@makeschool.com) and the
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com), and submit official transcripts for any
coursework completed off-campus while withdrawn. If you return, you will rejoin Make School with the
same academic standing as when you withdrew, and will be subject to the same requirements and
guidelines.

_Students who were academically dismissed from the college must apply for reinstatement, via the
standard admission processes, in order to be considered._
