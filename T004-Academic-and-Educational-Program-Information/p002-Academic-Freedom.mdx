## Academic Freedom

Make School is committed to the open analysis, discussion, and assessment of ideas and values. It
supports the proposition that education involves both analysis and re-evaluation of accepted ideas,
attitudes, and practices of the culture, with the aim of exploring new ways of thinking and acting
and opening new vistas of knowledge. Make School assumes that it is the responsibility of all
faculty to uphold the purposes and aims of the school.

Make School follows the Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom Issued by the
American Association of University Professors. All faculty members and students are afforded due
process. Members of the Make School community have the right to petition a grievance and request an
appeal of dismissal or disciplinary action.
