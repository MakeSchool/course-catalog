## Course Credit Hours

A credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by
evidence of student achievement. The amount of work required for a credit is calculated in one of
the following ways:

- One credit hour equates to 12.5 hours of direct instruction (either in-class hours with an
  instructor or supported project hours with an instructor, teaching assistant or industry expert)
  and 25 hours of out of class student work per term. In-class hours are based on a 50 min class per
  credit hour allowing for breaks and transition between classes.

- One credit hour equates to 37.5 hours of student work per term for other academic activities as
  established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practicum, studio work,
  community-based learning, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

The number of hours per week required for a credit is calculated from the total credits and the term
length. For a typical 3-credit hour course in a 7 week term, the 37.5 total hours of direct
instruction equates to 5.5 hours a week of direct instruction. In addition, homework and other
out-of-class work constitutes 75 hours total or 10.7 hours per week.

Technology-enhanced, Hybrid, or Online Courses: Courses offered through these modalities are to be
delivered so that the sum of faculty instruction and student preparation time is equivalent to the
relevant credit hour calculations above. The table below summarizes course credit hours for all
course types at Make School.
