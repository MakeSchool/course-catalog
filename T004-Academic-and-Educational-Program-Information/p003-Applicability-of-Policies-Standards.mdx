## Applicability of Policies & Standards

The Course Catalog & Student Handbook, and all policies and procedures outlined therein are
applicable to all Make School students at all times. Students are responsible for being aware of
these policies and following them. Enrollment at Make School implies acceptance of these policies
and procedures and makes them binding for all students.

This Catalog and its policies and procedures should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
mission and values of Make School. The Dean (or their designee) will resolve any questions involving
the application or interpretation of these policies, rules, and expectations. In such instances, the
decision of the Dean (or their designee) will be final and binding.
