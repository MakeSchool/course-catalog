## **Periodic Review of Course Credit Hours**

Application of the Credit Hour Policy will be reviewed during the Academic Program Review process to ensure that credit hour assignments are accurate, reliable, and appropriate to degree level. Supporting evidence includes syllabi, learning outcomes, assignment schedules, and course schedules identifying the times that courses meet (if applicable).

New courses, or changes in the unit value of existing courses, should be reviewed and approved by the faculty curriculum committee for compliance with the credit hour policy.
