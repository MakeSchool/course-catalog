## Internship (SWE) Tuition Policy

Students at Make School are expected to participate in one internship (SWE) to qualify for graduation.

* For the 2020-2022 cohort, students will not be charged tuition for their SWE internship. Therefore, students will be charged for their second summer of classes at Make School.

* If a student does not take a SWE during the 1st or 2nd summer at Make School, they will be charged the Summer Tuition price of $10,000 for each semester and be invoiced.

* If a student does not take a SWE during the 1st or 2nd summer at Make School (decided at the end of Year 2, Term 4), a student will need to talk with their academic advisor about Part-Time Tuition for their final term or Year 3 Financing.
