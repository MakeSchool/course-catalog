## Coaching

Countless innovators have coaches. You and your coach will meet throughout your time at Make School.
Your coachâ€™s sole purpose is to support you. Their job is not to tell you what to do, but to let you
lead the session, help you strategize flawlessly for yourself, tease out what you want and need, and
tap into your talents and the resources available to you. We believe that you have everything you
need to be successful: work ethic, creativity, drive. Your coach is here to be your advocate and
thought partner.
