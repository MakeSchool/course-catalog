### Accreditation

Make School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges Senior College and
University Commission (WASCUC) via its
[incubation policy](https://www.wscuc.org/content/incubation-policy) relationship with Dominican
University of California. As of Spring 2020, Make School will begin pursuing independent
accreditation from WASCU. Until Make School is granted independent accreditation, Make School will
remain in the WASCU approved incubation policy relationship with Domincian University of California
and therefore will continue to be accredited by WSCUC. Upon receiving accreditation, Make School
will end its incubation policy relationship Dominican University of California and will operate as
an independent educational agency.
