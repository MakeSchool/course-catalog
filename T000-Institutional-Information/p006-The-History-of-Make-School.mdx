### The History of Make School

Make School was founded in 2012, initially as a Summer Academy, to introduce high school and college
students to the potential of using technology to solve problems. The program was designed to be
project-based and collaborative, focused on teaching students to use modern software development
tools and frameworks. The Summer Academy taught thousands of students from around the world how to
build products, and enabled students to earn internships and jobs at top tech companies.

In 2014, Make School began building a new college based on the same principles. In just five short
years, we laid a strong foundation that has aimed to improve the relevance of higher education and
help address the growing student debt crisis. Our alumni have gone on to work at companies like
Google, Facebook, Tesla and dozens of other tech companies, putting our outcomes on par with top
universities. Weâ€™re excited to continue evolving over the next five years, actively diversifying the
tech industry, innovating ways to improve the college model, and sharing what we learn with more
institutions of higher education.
