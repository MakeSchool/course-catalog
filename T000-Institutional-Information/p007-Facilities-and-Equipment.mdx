Make School may be easily accessed via public transportation.

workspaces, a maker space, secure bike parking, and multiple restrooms. Make School provides
students with secure, high speed wireless internet, at no additional cost to students, while on the
main campus.

For instructional purposes, Make School utilizes the following equipment and technology: projectors
and projection screens, white boards, printers, speakers and microphones, as well as high-speed
internet, GitHub, Slack, and laptops.

## **Laptops**

Every student must have a fully-operating laptop on which to do their work. The minimum laptop
requirements are, as follows:

- An Apple Laptop

- At least 8 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM)

- At least 100 GB of Solid State Drive (SSD) Storage

- A fully-functioning keyboard and screen and a battery that holds a charge

Since purchasing a laptop can be a large financial burden, we can provide advice for how to find an
economical laptop that will serve you well. Some simple tips are:

- **Upgrade:** If you have an older Apple laptop that lacks SSD storage, you can check if your
  laptop is upgradeable with a new SSD storage component and more memory. If so, the most economical
  option is to purchase an SSD storage and RAM, then install them in your laptop.

- **Buy Used:** Many websites, including Craigslist and eBay, offer less expensive used laptop
  options. When buying a computer through a reseller, confirm with the seller that the laptop is
  fully functioning and that the computer is in decent operating condition. It is especially
  important to focus on the battery, charging cables, keyboard, screen, and USB ports.

- **Buy Refurbished:** You can buy a refurbished MacBook Air for approximately $900. If you combine
  this with a financing option, you may only need to pay approx. $75/month for 12 months.

- **Buy with Apple or Retail Financing:** Apple and other retail stores often offer financial
  options to allow you to pay for a computer over 12 months with no interest.

## **Temporary Laptop Assistance**

We understand how important it is to have a properly functioning laptop in order to be effective at
Make School. Students are responsible for securing a temporary laptop in the event that their
current laptop is inoperable and needs to be repaired. Make School may be able to assist students
with the cost associated with renting a laptop. For more information regarding temporary laptop
assistance, contact [student.affairs@makeschool.com](mailto:student.affairs@makeschool.com).
