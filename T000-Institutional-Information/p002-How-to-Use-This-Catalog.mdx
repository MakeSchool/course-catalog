# How to Use This Catalog

Welcome to Make School! We are excited to have you be a part of our community! We have provided this
Course Catalog and Student Handbook to help you during your time at Make School.

The Course Catalog and Student Handbook is designed to be a reference guide for all things related
to your student experience: from classes you might take, to campus activities, to student financial
aid. We’ve done our best to be as comprehensive as possible, and do update the information when
there is a major program change.

How to use this Course Catalog and Student Handbook:

- This should be the first place you go to find information or answers to questions about the
  program.

- Use the links in the table of contents to quickly search and find what you are looking for.

- There is a lot of information provided in this document. Read it carefully and thoroughly to make
  sure you understand the content.

- You are responsible for the information and upholding the policies included in this document. It
  is your responsibility to read and familiarize yourself with the Course Catalog and Student
  Handbook.

- **This guide is designed with you in mind.** Let us know if there is something you don’t
  understand or need clarity on so we can improve the information provided in this document.

For quick access to important information, forms, documents, or other items, the
[Appendix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cP3HyewqxDk3RglFfZA8ju7wSDhBHWpeJi5vWlXK9l8/edit#heading=h.r6g3lcy73iw9)
has a list of links to things most commonly used or asked about by Make School Students. This is a
great place to start if you’re not sure what you are looking for.
