# Mission Statement

Make School’s mission is to create avenues of upward mobility for students of all backgrounds,
empowering them to contribute to society through science and technology innovation.

We fulfill this mission by serving a majority under-resourced and underrepresented student
population through a Bachelor’s degree program, countering systemic barriers to upward mobility and
preparing them for high-earning careers.

Make School is built on the following values:

- **Students-first** - we put student needs first when making decisions and protect students’
  investment in their education through innovative financing options.

- **Innovation** - we operate using progressive organizational principles, cutting-edge education
  methodologies, and regular experimentation.

- **Relevance** - we develop curriculum and partnerships to ensure the education we provide prepares
  students for productive careers in industry and to be engaged members of civil society.

- **Equity** - we analyze our actions and decisions through the lenses of Justice, Equity,
  Diversity, and Inclusion in order to create a more equitable future for all. We serve students
  traditionally underrepresented in the technology industry.

- **Citizenship** - our students actively engage with their communities and create positive social
  impact. Students work on projects and seek employment to help solve key societal problems.
  Students formalize their ethical frameworks, practice empathy, respect diversity, and reject bias.

- **Personal Growth** - we provide educational resources and mentorship to help students and staff
  develop a growth mindset and achieve personal growth.

- **Transparency** - our policies, practices, planning, offerings, and student outcomes are hosted
  on a public-facing, version-controlled platform. Our affiliations with partners are publicly
  disclosed.
