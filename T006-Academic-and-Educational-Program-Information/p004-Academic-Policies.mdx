## Academic Honesty & Integrity Policy

Students are expected to practice academic integrity in all of its forms, including abstaining from
plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic misconduct. Make School reserves the right to
determine in any given instance what action constitutes a violation of academic honesty and
integrity.

Plagiarism, defined as the practice of presenting another's work or ideas as one’s own, is an act of
academic dishonesty and is a serious ethical and scholarly violation. Copying text or ideas, whether
verbatim or by paraphrasing from a source without using proper citation, is not accepted at Make
School. Any materials incorporated into your work, regardless of format, must be properly
acknowledged using a citation style appropriate for the discipline of the course.

Though plagiarism may be the most common form, other violations of scholarly integrity also
constitute cheating, including:

- Using or copying information from another student’s code or written work;
- Copying information from another student’s test or using unauthorized materials during an
  examination, whether an in-class or take-home exam;
- Buying, selling, or stealing test questions, answers, or term papers;
- Doing work or taking tests on behalf of another student or submitting work done by another person;
- Falsifying data or laboratory results; and
- Submitting the same work for more than one course without explicit instructor approval.

If an incident of plagiarism or cheating occurs, the instructor will investigate the incident and
consult with the Dean. If the student has been found to have committed an act of academic
dishonesty, an [Academic Misconduct Report](make.sc/academic-misconduct-report) will be filed and
the student will be placed on a [Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr). A
student who believes they have been wrongly accused of plagiarism or cheating, or that the
instructor’s resolution of the alleged incident is unjust, may file a
[Request for Appeal of Disciplinary Action](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr). TK_FIX links pip and request
for appeal

## Attendance & Participation Policy

Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success.
Attendance means being available (either online or on-campus) from 9:30am to 5:30pm PST each
weekday, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, coaching and school meetings, and
working on homework and group projects when not in a scheduled session. Being available for the
entire school day allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors
and others, and is vital to your learning.

Unless otherwise noted, attendance requirements for classes and other scheduled sessions are:

- No more than two unexcused absences (“no call, no show”) per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than two excused absences (communicated in advance) per term in any scheduled session.

It is the student’s responsibility to know the attendance policy in each course for which they are
registered, and also to notify their instructor and coach by email or slack immediately when they
know an absence is necessary. A student who is ill for more than one week, or who has a family
emergency, should also contact the [Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).

## Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)

The Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) affords you certain rights with respect
to your education records. Your rights include:

- The right to inspect and review your education records within 45 days of requesting access.
- The right to request the amendment of your records, if you believe them to be inaccurate,
  misleading, or otherwise in violation of your privacy rights under FERPA.
- The right to provide written consent before Make School discloses personally identifiable
  information from your records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without
  consent.
- The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by
  the School to comply with the requirements of FERPA:

        Family Policy Compliance Office

        U.S. Department of Education

        400 Maryland Avenue

        SW Washington, DC 20212-8520

        1-800-872-5327

The School has authority under the Act and **may** release “directory information” concerning
students. “Directory information” may include the student’s name, contact information, date and
place of birth, photo, enrollment status, dates of attendance, concentration of study, class level,
course load, degrees and awards received, date(s) of degree(s), participation in officially
recognized activities, and previous educational institutions attended by the student. This authority
will only be exercised when absolutely necessary.

The above-designated information is subject to release by the School at any time unless the School
has received prior written objection from the student specifying information which they do not agree
to be released. If you would like to make such a request, please contact the
[Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com) for the FERPA Release Form. This should be completed
annually within the first two weeks of the Fall semester.

Further information on FERPA is available at the US Department of Education FERPA website:
