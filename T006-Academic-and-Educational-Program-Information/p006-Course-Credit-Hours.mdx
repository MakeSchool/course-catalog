# Course Credit Hours

The Carnegie Unit defines a semester unit of credit as equal to a minimum of three (3) hours of work
per week for a semester. This means that one (1) unit of credit equates to three (3) hours of
student work per week (1 hour direct instruction plus 2 hours of homework or 3 hours of lab) for 15
weeks. Direct instruction hours are based on a 50 min class per credit hour allowing for breaks and
transition between classes.

Courses offered in a term of fewer than 15 weeks or in a different format (accelerated, weekend,
hybrid, or distance education) require the same contact hours and preparation time as a 15-week
course; or, if a course has reduced contact hours, the total workload will reflect commensurately
increased expectations for hours of preparation.

As such, the Make School credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes
and verified by evidence of student achievement. The amount of work required for a credit is
calculated in one of the following ways:

- One credit hour equates to 12.5 hours of direct instruction (either in-class hours with an
  instructor or supported project hours with an instructor, teaching assistant or industry expert)
  and 30 hours of out of class student work per term. **Note:** 12.5 hours is calculated by using a
  50 minute class period per credit hour (15hrs \* 50 min per hour = 12.5 hrs)
- One credit hour equates to 45 hours of student work per term for other academic activities as
  established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practicum, studio work,
  community-based learning, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

The number of hours per week required for a credit is calculated from the total credits and the term
length. For a typical 3-credit hour course in a 7 week term, the 37.5 total hours of direct
instruction equates to 5.5 hours a week of direct instruction. In addition, homework and other
out-of-class work constitutes 90 hours total or 12.8 hours per week.
