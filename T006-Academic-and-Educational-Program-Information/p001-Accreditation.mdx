# Accreditation

Make School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges Senior College and
University Commission (WSCUC) via its
[incubation policy](https://www.wscuc.org/content/incubation-policy) relationship with Dominican
University of California. In Spring 2021, Make School began pursuing independent accreditation from
WSCUC. Until Make School is granted independent accreditation, Make School will remain in the WSCUC
approved incubation policy relationship with Domincian University of California and therefore will
continue to be accredited by WSCUC. Upon receiving accreditation, Make School will end its
incubation policy relationship Dominican University of California and will operate as an independent
educational agency.
