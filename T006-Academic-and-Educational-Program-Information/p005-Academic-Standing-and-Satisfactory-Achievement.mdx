# Academic Standing and Satisfactory Achievement

Students’ satisfactory achievement (progress) and standing in the Bachelor of Science in Applied
Computer Science program is measured by course load, course completion rate, and degree completion
progress. Students receive mid-term reports to assess their ability to complete their courses and
remain in good standing.

## Course Load

In any given term, you should be taking 4 courses (standard load) from the following categories:

- Software Product Development Core (SPD, INT, SWE),
- Technical Courses as determined by your concentration, and
- Science & Letters (S&L)

The 4 (at least 12 credits) course requirements per term:

- Fall & Spring Terms (Terms 1 - 4): 1 SPD Course, 2 Technical Courses, 1-2 S&L Course(s)
- Intensives (INT): Offered in the Fall, Winter, and Spring of the 1st and 2nd year of study.
- Summer Term **with** Internship: Internship (SWE), 1 S&L Course
- Summer Term **without** Internship (alternate to Internship Summer): SPD 1.5, 1 -2 Technical
  Course(s), 1-2 S&L Course(s)

A standard course load is three technical courses (3 credits each) and one S&L course (2 credits per
term, 4 credits per semester). A standard course load is 11 credits which equates to 66 hours per
week.

## Non-Standard Course Load

If you want to register for a course load of more or less than 4 courses, or otherwise differentiate
from the above requirements in any term, you must meet with your academic advisor and complete the
[Non-Standard Academic Course Load Form](http://make.sc/non-standard-course-load). Submitting this
form means you are aware that not taking the required courses may impact your potential career
opportunities, degree progress, and ISA payback plan. It is not possible to defer any SPD, Intensive
(INT) or Internship (SWE) requirement.

If you choose to take a less than full-time course load or do not follow your degree plan, you may
be required to spend extra time at Make School to ensure that all degree requirements are completed.
Students should be aware that not enrolling in a full-time course load may impact their ability to
be eligible for financial aid.

## Mid-Term Reporting Policy

Your academic progress is reported by your instructors during every mid-term period. If you fall
behind, they will be notified and given additional support.

## Degree Completion Progress

In order to stay in good Academic Standing:

- You cannot fail more than 3 courses per academic year.
- If you fail any SPD, INT, or required Technical Course, you must retake _and_ pass that course at
  the next available offering.
- You must have met the following milestones per the bi-annual unit and portfolio guidelines:
  - Year 1, End of Term 2: 17-23 Units completed.
  - Year 1, End of Term 5: 50-60 Units, 2 Portfolio Projects completed, and all foundational courses
    complete.
  - Year 2, End of Term 2: 67-83 Units and 3 Portfolio Projects completed.
  - Year 2, End of Term 5: 106-124 Units, Internship, and 4 Portfolio Projects completed.

## Failure to Maintain Good Academic Standing or Achievement

If a student does not stay in good Academic Standing or are at risk of failing to maintain good
Academic Standing, they may be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).

## Academic Dismissal

As a strictly Pass/Fail program, good academic standing is based upon the quality of work shown and
the student's mastery of the course material and determined by the student's advisor/coach, in
consultation with the Dean. If a student is unable to stay in Good Academic Standing and/or fails to
satisfy requirements of the PIP, they may be asked to leave Make School.

## Appeals

A student may appeal their dismissal and petition for immediate reinstatement. Such an appeal must
be made in writing within the time limit indicated on the dismissal notification letter and must
have the support of the student’s advisor. The appeal letter should be directed to the Appeals
Committee, in care of the Registrar. The Committee has the discretion to:

1. Reinstate the student with an updated PIP, or
2. Deny the petition and allow the dismissal to stand.
