### Registration

Many courses are only offered in one term during the academic year, which requires taking them in a
specific sequence to stay on track to earn a degree. Students should consult with their academic
advisor before registering for courses. All registration requests are submitted through the Course
Enrollment Portal and must be approved before students will be enrolled in courses.

First time students will register during orientation after taking diagnostic exams. Returning
students generally begin registering two weeks before the start of each term; specific dates will be
announced to the student body via email.

#### Add/Drop Process

You may request to Add or Drop a course until the Add/Drop deadline (see the
[Academic Calendar](http://make.sc/academic-calendar)) by filling out the
[Add-Drop form ](make.sc/course-add-drop-form)with instructor signature. It is your responsibility
to ensure this process is completed.

#### Auditing a Course vs. "Sitting-In" on a Class

Students in good standing (who are not on a
[Participation Improvement Plan](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr)) may audit a course with instructor
approval, provided that the student: has taken the course previously and would like to revisit the
material; or has an [Incomplete grade](#heading=h.46zoxwdj1mjj) for the course from the previous
term, and seeks to gain further mastery of the material to complete the course.

Students in good standing, who have not been approved to audit a course, may request to "sit in" on
one class session of a course. After being granted approval, the student must coordinate with the
instructor regarding which particular session(s) they will join.

#### Concurrent Registration

Make School students may concurrently enroll to take Science & Letters or Foreign Language courses
at off-campus accredited institutions and be granted transfer credit for these courses. The maximum
number of transferable units via concurrent registration is 9 units. However, due to unit
requirements, seniors with 36 or less units remaining will only be approved for concurrent
enrollment in off-campus courses for a maximum of 8 units.

Students are required to obtain prior approval for any coursework they seek to take at another
institution, and all other relevant transfer policies apply to concurrent registration. All
authorizations for off-campus registration must be approved by the Make School Registrar Office
prior to the student’s concurrent enrollment. Students must pass the course in order to receive
credit. Make School will reimburse students who pass their class and receive credit. See step 6 for
more information (below).

#### Process

1. Review the Make School [Articulation Agreements](#heading=h.8q9hb4reuwvw) to see which classes
   have been pre-approved for credit at local colleges. You should also make sure the course is
   offered during the desired term as not all pre-approved classes will be offered at all times
   during the academic year. You are welcome to find classes on your own and submit for approval,
   but there is no guarantee that classes not on the articulation agreement list will be approved.

2. Complete the
   [Authorization to Take Course(s) Off-Campus Form](https://make.sc/off-campus-courses) **_prior_**
   to enrollment in the course. This will help you avoid unnecessary fees and enrollment steps, etc.

   1. Complete the form. Incomplete forms will not be accepted for approval.

   2. Submit the form to [registrar@makeschool.com](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).

3. Once approved, register in the course as soon as possible to ensure you are able to get into the
   approved class as courses do fill up quickly. Registering as an auditor or "sitting in" means you
   will not receive a grade or transcript credit for the course.

   3. Note: Unless already admitted, you will need to apply for admission to the College in order to
      enroll in the approved course. Admissions is free or fees can be waived at most community
      colleges in the Bay Area.

   4. Save your documentation of course enrollment.

4. Take and pass the class.

5. Submit proof of passing the class (transcript) to the Registrar at
   [registrar@makeschool.com](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com)

6. To request reimbursement for the course, submit the
   [Off-Campus Registration Reimbursement Form](make.sc/off-campus-course-reimbursement). In
   completing the form, you will need to submit proof of passing the class and invoices and/or
   receipts of your expenditures. Make School will reimburse up-to $500 in tuition, transportation
   costs, and course materials.

#### Withdrawing from a Course

With prior approval from the student’s coach or advisor, students may request to Withdraw from a
course with a "W" grade until the Withdrawal deadline. To do this, you must complete an
[Add/Drop Form](http://make.sc/course-add-drop-form) and meet with your coach for approval. Once
your coach has signed the form in the Advisor field, located at the top of the form, you must then
submit it to the[ Registrar.](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com)
