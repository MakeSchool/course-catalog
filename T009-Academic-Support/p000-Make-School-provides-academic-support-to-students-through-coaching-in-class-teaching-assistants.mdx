Make School provides academic support to students through coaching, in-class teaching assistants,
and an open plan workspace that encourages students to help each other through academic challenges.

You can access academic support in three ways: through the development of coach-coachee
relationships, in-class teaching assistants, and an open plan workspace that encourages students to
help each other through academic challenges. If you are uncertain where to go for academic support,
your coach should be your first point of contact! All Academic Support Programs are available to
both online and on-campus students.
