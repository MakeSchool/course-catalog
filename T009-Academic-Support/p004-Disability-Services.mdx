# Disability Services

Make School is committed to providing effective, reasonable accommodations to qualified students
with disabilities in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA). In compliance with these regulations, it is the policy of the college
to provide an educational environment that is free from all forms of discrimination, including
discrimination based on disability in the administration of its policies and programs.

Both online and on-campus students are entitled to reasonable accommodations in accordance with ADA.

**To qualify as having a disability at Make School, the student must have a physical, sensory,
learning, or psychological impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities,
and must also be able to provide documentation of such impairment. While students with temporary
illnesses, injuries, or conditions are not considered disabled under these laws, Make School will
make appropriate adjustments and assist them with available resources.**

Once admitted to Make School, you are responsible for requesting accommodations for a disability via
the [Disability Services Intake Form](make.sc/ada-intake-form). You will meet with the ADA
Coordinator, and through advising and support, we will ensure accommodations are provided to remove
competitive disadvantages, enabling you to realize their academic potential and objectives.
Information disclosed throughout this process will remain private in keeping with FERPA (see below).

Make School prohibits discrimination against any individual with a disability, and further prohibits
harassment or retaliation against any individual requesting an accommodation, or any individual who
files a grievance regarding non-compliance with this policy.

Please note that all disability-related information (including documentation, accommodation letters,
correspondence, and consultations) are considered private and will be managed in accordance with The
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations. Your information will not be shared
without your expressed, written consent, and all disability-related documentation will be destroyed
within 1-2 years of your graduation from Make School.
