# CoWork

Make School offers weekly CoWork sessions to provide students with support in technical and
non-technical coursework, time management, job/internship search, resume reviews, and interview
prep. Various staff and teaching assistants are available during each session to support all
students who need help. Students are also welcome to use CoWork as a time to work independently or
do pair coding with their peers as a means of accountability and staying on top of their work.
