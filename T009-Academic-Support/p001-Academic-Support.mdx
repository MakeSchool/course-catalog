# Academic Support

Make School provides academic support to students through coaching, in-class teaching assistants,
and an open plan workspace that encourages students to help each other through academic challenges.

You can access academic support in three ways: through the development of coach-coachee
relationships, in-class teaching assistants, and an open plan workspace that encourages students to
help each other through academic challenges. If you are uncertain where to go for academic support,
your coach should be your first point of contact! All Academic Support Programs are available to
both online and on-campus students.

## CoWork

Make School offers weekly CoWork sessions to provide students with support in technical and
non-technical coursework, time management, job/internship search, resume reviews, and interview
prep. Various staff and teaching assistants are available during each session to support all
students who need help. Students are also welcome to use CoWork as a time to work independently or
do pair coding with their peers as a means of accountability and staying on top of their work.

## Teaching Assistants

Teaching Assistants are students who have taken the course before and can support you in debugging,
working through code issues and learning the core concepts of the class. Teaching Assistants are
chosen by the course instructor on a term by term basis.
