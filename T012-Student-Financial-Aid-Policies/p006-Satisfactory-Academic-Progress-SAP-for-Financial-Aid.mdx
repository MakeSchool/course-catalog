# Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for Financial Aid

Federal Regulations require Make School to establish, publish and apply the requirements of
Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for Financial Aid eligibility. This policy pertains to
Institutional, Federal and/or State Financial Aid and is separate from the Academic Policies
established by Make School. The policies for Satisfactory Academic Progress at Make School are
aligned with all
[Dominican Satisfactory Academic Progress](https://www.dominican.edu/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid/financial-aid-policies/satisfactory-academic-progress)
policies while also addressing the unique term schedule and grading policies of the Make School
Program.

## SAP Evaluation

Make School is responsible for measuring and enforcing Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)
requirements to ensure Financial Aid recipients’ progress towards graduation. To be eligible for
Financial Aid, a student must be in good academic standing and making satisfactory progress towards
the completion of a degree within a maximum time-frame. All enrolled students are evaluated after
each semester to ensure that the minimum requirements are being met. Students failing to meet the
minimum requirements will be assigned one of the following statuses:

**Financial Aid Warning:** If a student fails to meet the SAP requirements, the student will be
placed on Financial Aid Warning for the following semester (or the next semester that the student
enrolls). While on Financial Aid Warning, the student may retain their Financial Aid eligibility and
receive a Financial Aid Award. At the end of the Financial Aid Warning semester, the student’s
record will be re-evaluated. If the student is meeting the SAP requirements after the Financial Aid
Warning semester, the student may be taken off of Financial Aid Warning and re-establish Financial
Aid eligibility for the following semester (or the next semester that the student enrolls).
Financial Aid Warning is only allowed once, during the student’s degree tenure at Make School.

**Financial Aid Suspension:** If a student fails to meet the SAP requirements for any semester after
the initial Financial Aid Warning semester, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension
and will not be eligible for Federal, State and/or Institutional Financial Aid. The status of
Financial Aid Suspension will remain in place until the student is again meeting the SAP
requirements or the student has filed a successful SAP Appeal.

## SAP Guidelines

The academic year at Make School consists of three semesters (fall, spring and summer) that are
subdivided into terms and intensives. Terms last 7 weeks and intensives last either 1 or 2 weeks.
This is shown in the table below.

Make School is an accelerated program and full time students enroll in 12 units per term, 24 units
per semester for fall and spring, and 15 units during the summer semester.

If a student changes concentrations or academic programs, all units reflected on the transcript for
that academic level will be included in the qualitative and quantitative measurements.

**Qualitative Standard**

Make School uses a pass / fail grading structure and does not issue a GPA. A passing grade in a
course is computed through a combination of assessment measures including exams, assignments and
learning outcome rubrics. A passing grade is equivalent to an A, B or C in a standard grading model
and students do not pass nor receive credit for courses completed with any grade lower than C.

Students will be evaluated against the following comparable assessment measured against a norm at
each evaluation period.

- For the purposes of Satisfactory Academic Progress, students are expected to pass at least half of
  their courses attempted in each evaluation period which is considered equivalent to a C average in
  a standard GPA model.
  - Grades of W or F do not count as a Pass and are included in the total number of courses
    attempted.
  - Grades of Incomplete are not included in the total number of courses attempted and do not impact
    calculation results.
- Students may repeat a course for which the student has previously earned credit(s) no more than
  one (1) time. The repeated course will be counted in the GPA calculation for the student one time.
  Any course repeated more than once will not be counted for GPA purposes

**Quantitative Standard**

Students are required to maintain a minimum quantitative Completion Rate of 67% in order to remain
eligible for Financial Aid. Completion Rate is calculated by dividing a student’s total earned
credits by the student’s total attempted credits.

- Attempted credit is defined as any credit(s) the student remains enrolled in after the Census
  Date, including credits that a student withdraws from
- Courses of Incomplete, Withdrawn, and Fail do not count as earned credits.
- Only courses with a Pass count as earned credits.
  - EX: A student is enrolled in four courses (12 credits) after Census Date. They Pass three
    courses and Fail one course. The completion rate is 9/12 = 75%. The student has met the
    completion rate criteria.
  - EX: A student is enrolled in four courses (12 credits) after Census Date. They Pass two courses,
    Withdraw from one course and Fail one course. The completion rate is 6/12 = 50%. The student has
    **not** met the completion rate criteria.

**Maximum Time-Frame**

Students are required to complete all degree requirements within 150% of the published program
length. The published program length of the Bachelor’s Degree program is 124 credits, 150% of this
is 186 credits.

- If it has been determined that a student will be unable to complete the program within the maximum
  time-frame, either by falling below the pace standard or it becomes mathematically impossible to
  complete their program within the maximum time-frame, the student is not eligible for Federal
  and/or State Aid
- If there are mitigating circumstances that affect the student’s ability to complete the program
  within the maximum time-frame a student may appeal to allow for additional semesters to complete
  the program

**Repeat Coursework**

If a student has received a passing grade for a course, Federal Aid may be applied to the payment of
that course for one additional semester. Repeated courses beyond the initial retake will be excluded
from the enrollment calculation. Also, repeated courses will be counted as hours attempted but not
earned when calculating the percentage of courses completed. Repeated courses will affect the
qualitative, quantitative, and time-frame measurements even if they are not eligible courses to
establish Financial Aid enrollment status.

- Only courses taken at Make School will be looked at under this policy.
- Courses that are available to take for credit more than one time are considered repeated for the
  purpose of this policy only if they are taken one time more than the number of times they can be
  taken for credit.
  - EX: SUP 2.1 may be taken twice for credit so taking it a third time would qualify as repeated
    coursework.

**Incomplete Coursework**

For purposes of evaluating SAP, grades of Incomplete count as attempted units, but not earned units
for the Quantitative Standard. Therefore an Incomplete grade may qualify the student for Financial
Aid Warning or Financial Aid Suspension until a grade has been posted.

## SAP Appeal Process

Students who have been placed on Financial Aid Suspension have the right to appeal their status to
the Office of Financial Aid. SAP Appeals must be based on extenuating circumstances that seriously
affected the student’s academic performance.

Examples of Extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to:

- Death in the family
- Disabling illness or injury to the student or immediate family member (that required the student’s
  care)
- Emotional or mental health issue of the student that required professional care
- Other extenuating circumstances that were beyond the student’s control

Appeals will not be accepted for any of the following reasons:

- Lack of knowledge/understanding of the SAP Policy
- Medical appeals for illness/injury/hospitalization that do not coincide with the semester(s) of
  sub-standard progress
- Work/Scheduling conflicts (including voluntary overtime)
- Acclimation issues with regard to being in a university setting
- Student has submitted a previous SAP appeal, regardless of reason, and the student is still not
  meeting SAP requirements
- Student is repeating courses to increase the student’s GPA or the student is taking courses for
  degree requirements outside the student’s current program
- Student is taking pre-requisite(s) for a degree program for which the student is not currently
  enrolled in

The SAP Committee will thoroughly review each appeal. If the SAP Committee needs clarification or
additional information, the committee will contact the student directly. Any requested documentation
is to be submitted as soon as possible. SAP Appeal decisions are final and will be emailed to the
student within 3-5 weeks of submission. Students are encouraged to submit their SAP appeal and
documentation as early as possible to allow on-time disbursement of aid if the appeal is approved.
