# Financial Aid Advising

Make Schoolâ€™s financial aid process combines Title IV funding and private loans with an income
protection plan called Extended Income-Based Repayment (EIBR) to help unemployed and underemployed
alumni of Make School keep their student loan payments affordable. Our financial aid advising
provides ample resources for understanding this program as well as navigating the financial aid
process.

Financial Aid advising begins with detailed descriptions of our financial aid policies on our
website. During the enrollment process, students are invited to financial aid webinars and 1:1
advising from our financial aid team to provide full insight into how our financial aid process
works. Once students have submitted their FAFSA, it is reviewed and each student is sent an
estimated Financial Aid Package that lists eligibility for aid or requests additional documents.
Financial aid advisors then meet with each student to go over their aid eligibility, discuss other
financing options as needed, and walk through the remaining steps required in order to complete
their file. Students have ongoing access to 1:1 advising from financial aid counselors throughout
the program.

As students approach graduation, they meet with financial aid to discuss the post graduation loan
repayment process and implementation of EIBR protection.
