### Hate Speech

Make School’s desire to foster a professional environment that honors the freedom of expression is
equally balanced with pursuit to create an inclusive living and learning environment. All members of
the Make School community are responsible for expressing themselves in a manner that is respectful
of others’ backgrounds, identities, and life experiences. This policy applies to all modes of
communication, including in-person, online (email, Slack, etc.), and visual media (mems, gifs, etc.)
