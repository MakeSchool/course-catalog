# Alcohol, Drug & Smoking

Smoking and the use of substances (alcohol or drugs), including marijuana, is not allowed on Make
School’s campus and in the residence hall(s). All students and staff who wish to smoke any
substance, or vape, must do so outdoors, following San Francisco city ordinance which requires
smokers to stand at least 20 feet from a building’s entrance. It is also not permissible for a
student to post imagery on social media accounts, which depict the use of these substances while
located on Make School property.

If it is determined that a student is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or has been smoking
or vaping on campus, any related contraband will be confiscated and the standard
[Performance Improvement Plan](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr) process will be followed.
