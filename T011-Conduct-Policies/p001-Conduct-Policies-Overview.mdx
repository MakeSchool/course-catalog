### Conduct Policies Overview

The policies described in this section of the Catalog are especially important for students to
understand, as violating these policies may result in the
[Formal Resolution](#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr) process. Students are expected to follow these policies
at all times. Reports regarding potential violations of these conduct policies can be submitted
using the [Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form).
