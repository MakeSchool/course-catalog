### Off-Campus Conduct

All students are expected to follow local, state and federal laws at all times. Make School may
determine, on a case-by-case basis, to address off-campus violations of local, state, and federal
through the student conduct process if the violation poses a health or safety risk to the Make
School community or is detrimental to the educational interest of others. Any student conduct
process will be independent from criminal proceedings and will not be impacted by the outcomes of
the legal process.

In the event off-campus conduct results in an arrest or criminal proceedings, students are
responsible for obtaining bail funding and legal counsel independently.
