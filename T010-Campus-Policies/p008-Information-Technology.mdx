### Information Technology

Information Technology is a key component to students’ success at Make School. We expect all
students to conduct themselves in a respectful, inclusive manner when communicating online and
through social media.

#### GSuite Account

All Make School students will receive an official Make School email address, which should be used
for all communication while you’re a student. This email address will be your legal first name, a
period, and your legal last name, followed by @students.makeschool.com (e.g.,
john.doe@students.makeschool.com). This account is part of the Google Suite, which also gives access
to all administrative Google interfaces (i.e., Google Drive, Google Docs, etc.).

#### GitHub Account

[GitHub](https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/) is our Learning Management System for the
technical courses at Make School. Be sure to register for an account prior to your first day of
classes.

#### Slack Account

[Slack](http://slack.com) is the main platform Make School uses for informal communication.
Announcements, reminders about action items, and community conversations are shared via this
service. It is important that you are attentive to your Slack channels and messages, as this is
often the fastest way to share information with colleagues and Make School staff. Students are
automatically invited to Slack upon enrollment. To access the student Slack workspace on your
computer or mobile device, open the email invitation sent to your Make School email account and
click "join." Slack will then guide you through the process of setting up your account.

#### Social Media Accounts

Make School has a robust [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/makeschool/) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/makeschool/) network! **Facebook** is used to enhance
internal communications among the Make School community. You can join the following Make School
groups on Facebook:

- [Make School Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MakeSchoolCommunity/)

- [Make School ](https://www.facebook.com/makeschool/)

- [Make School Women](https://www.facebook.com/groups/916655231787097/)

**LinkedIn** is a tool to connect internally with staff and students, as well as externally with
hiring partners, industry contacts, and other Make School affiliates. It is highly encouraged for
you to add connections and utilize this platform. LinkedIn is the number one way recruits reach out
to you when looking to hire, and it’s important that your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date with your
current projects, experience and education, and a professional headshot. We provide support to
students to create an effective LinkedIn profile.
