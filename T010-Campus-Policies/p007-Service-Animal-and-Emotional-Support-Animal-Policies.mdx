### Service Animal & Emotional Support Animal Policies

Please note that dogs are the only approved Service or Emotional Support Animal (ESA) species
permitted on the Make School campus. While dog breed and size are not inhibited in any way, all
other policies detailed below still apply. For protocol related to Service Animals / ESAs in
residences, please check with your housing provider for their specific regulations. ESAs are not
permitted in Housing for Make School Students at 851 California Street, per the property owner.

Service Animal Policy

The ADA defines a Service Animal as any dog (or in some cases other animals) that is individually
trained to work specifically for a person with a physical, sensory, psychiatric, or other
disability.

In compliance with applicable law, Service Animals are generally allowed in buildings, classrooms,
meetings, dining areas, activities and events when the animal is accompanied by an individual with a
disability who indicates the Service Animal is trained to and does provide a specific service to
them that is directly related to their disability.

Service Animals may not be permitted when the animal poses a substantial and direct threat to health
or safety or when the presence of the animal constitutes a fundamental alteration to the nature of
the program or service.

In situations where it is not obvious that the animal is a Service Animal, staff may ask only two
specific questions: (1) is the animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task
has the animal been trained to perform? Staff are not allowed to request any documentation for the
Service Animal, require that the Service Animal demonstrate its task, or inquire about the nature of
the person's disability.

Emotional Support Animal (ESA) Policy

Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) are animals that provide emotional support which alleviates one or
more identified symptoms or effects of an individualâ€™s existing disability. Animals whose sole
function is to provide comfort or emotional support are Emotional Support Animals, not Service
Animals.

A student seeking to bring an ESA onto the Make School campus, must make a formal request to
Operations personnel. The request should be made at least 30 days before the start of the semester
or academic year for which the presence of an ESA is requested. Documentation indicating the need
for an ESA must be current, presented on professional letterhead, and signed by the licensed
provider. This documentation must also specifically prescribe an ESA and note the type of animal
that is recommended.

In addition, before a specific ESA is approved, the Handler must submit documentation from a
licensed veterinarian that the ESA is in good health and that its required immunizations are up-
to-date. As part of the approval process, the individual requesting the ESA may be required to meet
with Make School representatives. Make School will provide written notification of animal-specific
approval of an ESA request. If an individual intends to replace an approved ESA with a new animal, a
new request must be made.
