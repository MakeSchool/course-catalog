# Insurance & Health Requirements

Make School expects all students to be covered by a medical insurance plan. Because healthcare costs
can become quite expensive, having an adequate plan that is accepted by local providers is very
important. In addition to requiring medical insurance, we also require the following forms to be
completed by all students:

- [Medical History Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jJQYXOpTKPnirWlC0aCzfwMmWbmC3C7a/view)

- [Immunization & TB Screening Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgxXLFwkNxcq-Is8crbZMUMvc5oEmT6N/view)

- [Health Requirements Checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IiTDCfFZqoPXSdgUOKJUaBjrTPO2yWKJ/view?usp=sharing)

All completed forms must be submitted to the
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).
