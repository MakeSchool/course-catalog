## Housing and Residence Life

Make School highly recommends, but does not require, all students live housing made available for
Make School. Recognized student housing is located at 851 California Street (seniors and super
seniors), and Bartlett and Herbert Halls (juniors).

Make School does not bear responsibility for assisting students in finding housing. However, we
recognize a number of circumstances may prevent students from being able to live in housing for Make
School students. Students who are seeking off-campus housing may contact

locating housing in the Bay Area.
