## Parking & Transportation

Make School is located in the heart of San Francisco, so parking is limited to city parking lots and metered street parking. Students and visitors are encouraged to take public transport to campus.

Public transit is, by far, the easiest way of navigating the bay area. The basic forms of transportation are, as follows:

* **AC Transit: **This is an Oakland-based public transit agency serving the western portions of Alameda and Contra Costa counties in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. AC Transit also operates "Transbay" routes across San Francisco Bay to San Francisco and selected areas in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.
**Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART): **This is a rapid transit public transportation system serving the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The heavy rail elevated and subway system connects San Francisco and Oakland with urban and suburban areas in Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Mateo counties.

* **CalTrain: **This is a California commuter rail line on the San Francisco Peninsula and in the Santa Clara Valley. The northern terminus of the line is in San Francisco at 4th and King streets; its southern terminus is in Gilroy.

* **The San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI): **This is the public transit system for the city and county of San Francisco, California. This includes the cable car system, the internal ‘subway’ system that navigates San Francisco, and buses.

Clipper Card

We recommend that you invest in a [Clipper Card](https://www.clippercard.com/), which simplifies paying for public transit by allowing you to reload funds automatically and online. It can also save you money! For example, if you opt to automatically reload a High Value Discount ticket for Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), you receive a 6.25% discount per ride. There are also monthly Muni passes for San Francisco fares, and the option of adding general cash value to your Clipper Card. Please note that loading BART funds onto your account will not allow you to use other forms of public transportation; you will have to load additional funds onto your Clipper Card to access additional modes of travel.
