# Alumni Relations

As a student of Make School, you will also be part of our stellar alumni community. Our alumni are
awesome resources; not only can they share their experiences as a student at Make School, but they
can also take on the role of Industry Contacts (or Mentors) as you progress in your career. You are
encouraged to join the Alumni Slack channel and reach out to alumni for support, advice, and
networking opportunities. Once you graduate from Make School, remember that your engagement
continues within the alumni community. Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to attend alumni community
events, work with alumni in the industry, and also to mentor current students. Moreover, as a Make
School Student, you will be provided continuous coaching and job support as an alumnus, courtesy of
our Student Career Services!
