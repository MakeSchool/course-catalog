# Health Insurance

Make School does not provide health insurance but all students are expected to have health
insurance. Because healthcare costs can become quite expensive, having an adequate plan that is
accepted by local providers is very important. If you are located in California, you can apply for
free healthcare via [Covered California](https://www.coveredca.com/medi-cal/). If you need
healthcare coverage but not based in California, you can purchase health insurance through your
stateâ€™s healthcare exchange or visit [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov). **Please note:
Students without health insurance may incur fees with the IRS for lack of coverage.**

In addition to requiring medical insurance, we also require the following
[history and immunization form](https://make.sc/makeschool_medicalforms) to be completed by all
students:

All completed forms must be submitted to the Admissions Office upon initial enrollment.
