# Campus Recreation

Make School’s on-campus experience includes a variety of recreational activities for students,
faculty, and staff. Some regular on-campus recreational activities include:

- A **Ping Pong Table** is available for student use. If you’re especially competitive, you can even
  partake in the student-run Ping Pong Tournaments!
- The **Manzanita Macaroon Maker Space**, located off of the Great Hall, is a room with Virtual
  Reality gaming access and contains equipment for our craftier students interested in modifying
  hardware.
- **Wellness Wednesday** offers students the opportunity to practice self-care through mindfulness,
  reflection, and physical activity.

Moreover, San Francisco is an extension of your campus! San Francisco is filled with different
neighborhoods, [club sports](http://www.sfsocialsportsclub.com/), food, sightseeing, architecture,
street fairs, concerts, and free activities! Here’s a list of

## Virtual Campus Recreation

Make School also provides a number of events and activities for remote students including virtual
hangouts, club meetings, coffee breaks, and game nights! If you have an interest in hosting an event
or starting a club, we encourage you to reach out to the Student Experience Team to get started!
