# Mental Health & Wellbeing

We know your mental health and physical wellbeing is an important component of your success at Make
School. We provide regular programming through events like Wellness Wendesays to help you stay
healthy and focused. This mental health programming is available for both online and on-campus
students; however, on-campus students may have access to additional in-person support or fitness
activities.

To support your mental health, Make School partners with [Better Help](http://betterhelp.com), an
online, on-demand licensed mental health counseling service, and these services are available to
both on-campus and online students.. You will receive unique log-in credentials upon your enrollment
of your first term at Make School and are able to use these services at no cost. You are
automatically given access to BetterHelp when you first enroll at Make School and is available to
you throughout your time at Make School. Graduates may receive an additional 6 months of services
upon request. BetterHelp is 100% confidential and what you share with your counselor will not be
shared with Make School. Both online and on-campus students have unlimited access to
[BetterHelp](betterhelp.com).

If your log-in expires, please contact Lisa Tran at
[lisa.tran@makeschool.com](mailto:lisa.tran@makeschool.com). You can contact Lisa for additional
support or information about BetterHelp.

Students can also review a comprehensive list of mental health resources at
[make.sc/mental-health-resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ONyKidX-a9HCrGVqA0c7JHMSWb85gUjFJlRx5sb9GFE/edit).
