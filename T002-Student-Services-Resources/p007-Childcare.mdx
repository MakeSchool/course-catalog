# Childcare

Make School does not provide childcare, but for students located in the Bay Area, the
[Childrenâ€™s Council](http://www.childrenscouncil.org/) can help. Please visit their website to see
the childcare services they offer. Online students should explore local childcare options or visit
[Care.com](https://care.com) for childcare options.
