# Lost and Found

If you lost something while on-camps at Make School, it is best to check the Lost and Found bin
located in the Student Resource Room. If you cannot locate your item(s), or if you want to report
adding an item to the Lost and Found bin, you can message the #lost-and-found Slack channel. The
Lost and Found bin will be cleared monthly.
