# Student Groups

We empower and encourage students to initiate leadership and ownership over clubs. Since each cohort
is unique, we let student voices be heard and support their goals rather than determining standard
clubs. In this way, clubs are inspired and self-formed by the community and its members. Previous
cohorts have organized a Drone Club, Hackathon Club, and Women in Tech Club. Make School staff
members with expertise and/or interest in an area can serve as guides and resources to support
student clubs. All students, regardless if they are enrolled in the online or the on-campus program
are encouraged to participate in student groups and are eligible for leadership opportunities.

## Student Council

Student Council is a Make School-sponsored group that consists of student advocates, nominated and
elected by their peers, who act as the voice of the student body. Student Council members
representatives include both online and on-campus students. The council has weekly meetings with the
Student Experience team to ensure students are happy, heard, and aware of the efforts employed to
support their life here at Make School. The members of the Student Council have the role of
listening to student concerns, and communicating these concerns to Make School staff. Student
Council is granted a budget and can plan student events in collaboration with the Student Experience
team.

## Student Clubs

Students have the opportunity to start and lead clubs at Make School based on their interests.
Leading a club is also a great way to gain some professional development and leadership skills. Some
examples of clubs include the Data Science Club, Technical Interview Club, and Dungeons & Dragons
Club.

## Peer Mentors

Peer Mentors are senior level students who have volunteered their time to help first-year students
transition to Make School. They can provide support with coursework, job/internship preparation, and
general adjustment to the Make School community.

## Student Event Coordinators

We encourage students to help organize school-related gatherings! Students who express an interest
in this role volunteer to meet bi-weekly with the Student Experience Team to plan and organize
monthly events for the student body and staff. Events include holiday celebrations, multicultural
day meals, talent shows, spring flings, and other school-sponsored functions.

## Student JEDI Committee

Students are welcome to participate in developing initiatives to support a diverse student
population. The student-led JEDI Committee (Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion) works with the
Student Experience team to host educational programs, trainings, and events to help foster a
welcoming and inclusive environment for all community members.
