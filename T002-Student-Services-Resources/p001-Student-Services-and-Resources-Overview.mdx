# Student Services & Resources Overview

This section of the Catalog focuses on any resources or support a student may need. This includes
points of contact for our college team staff, information about student clubs and campus recreation,
alumni relations and career services, and so much more. We encourage you to read this section in its
entirety as it includes information for both online and on-campus students.
