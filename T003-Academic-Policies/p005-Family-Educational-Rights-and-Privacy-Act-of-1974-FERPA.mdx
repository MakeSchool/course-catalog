# Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)

The Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) affords you certain rights with respect
to your education records. Your rights include:

- The right to inspect and review your education records within 45 days of requesting access.

- The right to request the amendment of your records, if you believe them to be inaccurate,
  misleading, or otherwise in violation of your privacy rights under FERPA.

- The right to provide written consent before Make School discloses personally identifiable
  information from your records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without
  consent.

- The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by
  the School to comply with the requirements of FERPA:

  Family Policy Compliance Office<br/> U.S. Department of Education<br/> 400 Maryland Avenue<br/> SW
  Washington, DC 20202-8520<br/> 1-800-872-5327

The School has authority under the Act to release "directory information" concerning students.
“Directory information” may include the student’s name, contact information, date and place of
birth, photo, enrollment status, dates of attendance, concentration of study, class level, course
load, degrees and awards received, date(s) of degree(s), participation in officially recognized
activities, and previous educational institutions attended by the student. This authority will only
be exercised when absolutely necessary.

The above-designated information is subject to release by the School at any time unless the School
has received prior written objection from the student specifying information which they do not agree
to be released. If you would like to make such a request, please fill out the
[FERPA Notice & Release Form](make.sc/ferpa-release). This should be completed annually within the
first two weeks of the Fall semester.

Further information on FERPA is available at the US Department of Education FERPA website:
