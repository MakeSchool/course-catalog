# Course Modalities

Courses at Make School are offered in either in-person, online synchronous, online asynchronous or
hybrid modalities.

## In-person delivery

In-person classes are taught on our campus and students are expected to be in attendance for the
entire class time. Class time includes many opportunities for active learning, group work, 1:1
instruction and guidance from the instructor or TA as well as traditional lecture format.

**NOTE: For 2020 Fall Term (and if necessary ongoing) all in-person classes will adhere to state and
local guidelines for COVID-19 including those limiting public gatherings. This may impact the amount
of in-person delivery available.**

## Online delivery

Synchronous online classes meet online for the same scheduled time as an in-person class in
compliance with credit hour policies. Class structure is similar to that of an in-person class with
the same key elements of lecture, active learning, group work and individual support time. In
asynchronous online classes, the lecture portion is presented over video and students work
independently with limited or no scheduled meeting times. There is still ample opportunity for
support from instructors via asynchronous modes such as slack, email or 1:1 online sessions.

## Hybrid delivery

Hybrid classes are a mixture of in-person and online components. The online component can be
synchronous or asynchronous as defined above. The in-person time is primarily used for active
learning and group work where the learning experience benefits from the in-person element. Students
are expected to attend both online and in-person components.

**NOTE: For 2020 Fall Term (and if necessary ongoing) all in-person components of hybrid classes
will adhere to state and local guidelines for COVID-19 including those limiting public gatherings.
This may impact the amount of in-person delivery available.**
