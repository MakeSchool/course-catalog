### **Attendance & Participation Policy**

Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success.
Attendance means being available (either online or on-campus) from 9:30am to 5:30pm PST each
weekday, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings,
and working on homework and group projects when not in a scheduled session. Being available for the
entire school day allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors
and others, and is vital to your learning.

Unless otherwise noted, attendance requirements for classes and other scheduled sessions are:

- No more than two unexcused absences ("no call, no show") per term in any scheduled session.

- No more than two excused absences (communicated in advance) per term in any scheduled session.

It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to know the attendance policy in each course for which they are
registered, and also to notify their instructor and coach by email or slack immediately when they
know an absence is necessary. A student who is ill for more than one week, or who has a family
emergency, should also contact the [Dean](mailto:anne@makeschool.com) and
[Office of the Registrar](mailto:registrar@makeschool.com).
